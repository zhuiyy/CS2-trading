      "Here is a summary of the latest news, price trends, and investment analysis relevant to today.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. The Big News: Introduction of \"Skin Renting\"\n",
      "The most critical news for investors is Valve's introduction of a rental mechanic for the **Kilowatt Case**.\n",
      "*   **The Update:** When using a key on a Kilowatt Case, players now have two options: receive a permanent item (the traditional way) OR **rent the entire collection** for 7 days.\n",
      "*   **The Mechanic:** If you choose to rent, the key is consumed, and you get access to every weapon skin in the collection (excluding the Kukri Knife) to equip and play with for a week. At the end of the week, the skins disappear.\n",
      "*   **Scope:** Currently, this only applies to the Kilowatt Collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Market Reaction & Price Trends (Last 24 Hours)\n",
      "The market is reacting violently to the rental news. Here are the immediate trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Kilowatt Skins Crash:** The prices for high-tier skins in the Kilowatt collection (e.g., **AK-47 | Inheritance**, **AWP | Chrome Cannon**) are plummeting. Because players can now \"rent\" these expensive skins for the price of a key (~$2.50), the demand to buy the permanent versions for $100+ has dropped sharply.\n",
      "*   **Case Prices:** The price of the Kilowatt Case itself is seeing volatility. Some speculate demand for the case will rise (as people buy it to rent skins), while others fear the value of the contents inside is now ruined, making the case less valuable to \"investors.\"\n",
      "*   **General Market (Liquid Items):** The broader market (Dopplers, older skins) is experiencing a slight \"panic dip.\" Uncertainty often causes players to sell off assets, fearing Valve might expand renting to older cases (though there is no evidence of this yet).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Gameplay Updates Affecting Market\n",
      "*   **Incendiary Grenade Changes:** The price of the Incendiary grenade was reduced to $500, and the visual/damage mechanics were changed. While not directly affecting skin prices, gameplay changes that retain player retention are positive for the long-term economy.\n",
      "*   **Vertigo Map Overhaul:** Significant changes to Bombsite A on Vertigo. Map-specific collections (like the Vertigo 2021 Collection) may see minor fluctuations as play rates on the map change.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Summary for Traders and Investors\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **The \"Rentals\" Risk**\n",
      "This is a fundamental change to the CS2 economy.\n",
      "*   **Bearish for Play Skins:** If renting expands to other collections, the value of \"Play Skins\" (skins people buy just to use, not collect) will drop significantly.\n",
      "*   **Bullish for Old/Rare Items:** Renting does not apply to older cases or operation collections yet. This may drive investors toward \"safe haven\" assets like discontinued cases, Kato 14/15 stickers, and old operation skins that cannot be rented.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Actionable Advice**\n",
      "*   **Do Not Panic Sell High-Tiers:** Do not panic sell Doppler knives or high-tier gloves. Renting currently excludes Rare Special Items (Knives/Gloves). Knives remain the only item in the case you strictly *have* to unbox or buy to possess.\n",
      "*   **Avoid Kilowatt Skins:** It is highly risky to buy an **AK-47 | Inheritance** or **M4A1-S | Black Lotus** right now. Prices are still finding their floor as the market adjusts to the rental supply.\n",
      "*   **Watch the Copenhagen Major Capsules:** The 75% off sale is still active. With the community distracted by the Rental update, this is a quiet accumulation period, but supply is likely massive.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Verdict**\n",
      "**Current Market Status:** **High Volatility / Bearish on New Skins.**\n",
      "The introduction of rentals effectively puts a \"cap\" on how much people are willing to pay for non-rare active-drop skins. Investors should pivot toward items that **cannot** be rented (Knives, Gloves, and Older Discontinued Collections).\n",
