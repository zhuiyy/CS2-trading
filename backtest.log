100 Thieves announce return to Counter-Strike
11-11-2025 04:52

The organization will return to the title after five years.

100 Thieves have announced their return to Counter-Strike after more than five years away from the title.

"Counter-Strike has always been a cornerstone of esports, and CS2 has sparked new energy worldwide," said Jacob Toft-Andersen, 100 Thieves' president.

"Europe is at the center of that community, and by establishing a permanent home there, we're committing to doing this the right way."

The news comes after a report from Dust2.dk stated that the organization is set to re-enter CS and sign Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard as the first piece of the puzzle.

100 Thieves' press release makes no mention of player signings, only that "further details about the new team roster and competitive schedule will be announced in the coming months."

This is set to be 100 Thieves' third stint in Counter-Strike. The organization first joined the space by signing the ex-Immortals team back in 2017, but the partnership ended unceremoniously after the lineup failed to play a single game for Nadeshot's American organization.

100 Thieves then returned in 2019 with a majority Australian lineup featuring Justin "⁠jks⁠" Savage and notably finished second at IEM Beijing before departing the space in October 2020.

13:54:43 | INFO     | The official return of 100 Thieves creates an immediate speculative demand shock for their out-of-print Berlin 2019 and 2020 RMR stickers, as the market prices in the hype of a potential "superteam" roster built around rain. The risk level is **High** due to the extreme volatility characteristic of announcement-day trading and the potential for a sharp correction once the initial euphoria subsides. **Recommendation: Buy** legacy 100 Thieves stickers to capitalize on the momentum leading up to the official roster reveal, as competing new supply is still months away from entering the market.

cadiaN returns on OG
12-11-2025 00:01

The Dane is back in action after seven months away from the server.

OG have announced the signing of Casper "⁠cadiaN⁠" Møller, confirming an earlier report by Dust2.dk.

The Dane joins a team that benched IGL Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard and sniper Nico "⁠nicoodoz⁠" Tamjidi in October, with the 30-year-old now set to fill both roles.

cadiaN has been out of action since April, when he was moved to Astralis' bench in favor of Rasmus "⁠HooXi⁠" Nielsen following the Danish organization's failure to qualify for a fifth consecutive Major.

cadiaN, who played as a rifling IGL in Astralis, struggled for individual form and averaged a 0.84 rating, with his previous stint in Liquid delivering similarly lacklustre results.

In OG, however, the Dane will have a chance to play alongside some younger players in an IGL-AWP role and rekindle some of the success he enjoyed in the latter years of his HEROIC stint.

cadiaN's signing means that OG have just one more roster vacancy left to fill before returning to the server.

OG are currently:

Sweden Olle "⁠spooke⁠" Grundström
Sweden Adam "⁠adamb⁠" Ångström
Portugal Rafael "⁠arrozdoce⁠" Wing
Denmark Casper "⁠cadiaN⁠" Møller

France Lambert "⁠Lambert⁠" Prigent (coach)

Denmark Christian "⁠Buzz⁠" Andersen (benched)
Denmark Nico "⁠nicoodoz⁠" Tamjidi (benched)
Denmark Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard (benched)



The EVPs and All-Stars of IEM Chengdu 2025
12-11-2025 01:29

FURIA and Vitality pick up a host of awards after a hard-fought grand final.

FURIA's wins at FPG2 and TWC were landmark moments for the organization, but IEM Chengdu represents a step up.

It's the team's biggest win to date, their first against truly elite competition, and it means they will head into the last two events of the year as the team with momentum.

Sniper Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko is the revelation that has made much of this possible, and he picked up his second MVP medal in China.

It means he is the heavy favorite for the Rookie of the Year title, an astonishing achievement for a player who only had 67 maps on HLTV when FURIA signed him from AMKAL in May.

But molodoy's eyes are firmly set on more team achievements: "It's good if I take Rookie of the Year," he told HLTV post-Chengdu, "but I'm just saying... it doesn't matter for me because first I want to win trophies."

13:56:30 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13:56:30 | INFO     | 1. **Risk Level:** Moderate volatility is expected, primarily driven by a surge in demand for FURIA assets following their major victory and speculative trading surrounding cadiaN's return to the active pool.

2. **Recommendation:** **Buy** FURIA team stickers and "molodoy" autographs aggressively, while maintaining a **Hold** position on legacy cadiaN (Heroic/Liquid era) foils and golds.

3. **Financial Analysis:** The Brazilian market's purchasing power combined with molodoy's MVP status and "Rookie of the Year" trajectory creates a bullish trend for FURIA items, whereas cadiaN's signing to a rebuilding OG roster presents a lower immediate ROI compared to the momentum of the Chengdu champions.

HLTV Prospect Report #1 update: molodoy jumps to first
13-11-2025 04:00

The Kazakh sniper becomes the top prospect after securing a second MVP award in his rookie year at the top level.


Now that we have plenty of data from July 1 through November 2, the HLTV Prospect Ranking needed a reshuffling. Our methodology is largely the same as it was in the first report, but we have added automated elements to the ranking by scoring players on key statistics and weighting them against event and opposition difficulty. This is an update of the ranking from the first report, and a new ranking with graduating players and newcomers will be published when the ongoing season is over.

HLTV Prospect Report #1
While this tweak has helped identify players we underrated initially like Asian talents Anarbileg "⁠cobrazera⁠" Uuganbayar, Shengxuan "⁠chengking⁠" Zu and Qianhao "⁠Moseyuh⁠" Chen, the main driving force behind players' movements up and down the list are their own form.


For instance, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko has won two MVPs in that time, going from strength to strength as FURIA's star sniper and hopped over Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin into first place.

The biggest movers are the likes of Klimentii "⁠kl1m⁠" Krivosheev and Dmytro "⁠dem0n⁠" Myroshnychenko, whose moves out of academy teams helped them play against tougher opposition and prove their worth. The last few months have also been good for David "⁠Dawy⁠" Bibik, who has shone for Inner Circle and TNL in the second half of the year, as well as Gytis "⁠ryu⁠" Glušauskas (1.17 rating since July) and João "⁠koala⁠" Pfeffer (1.18).

In terms of fallers, prospects like Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, Corey "⁠nettik⁠" Browne, and Jaxon "⁠Peeping⁠" Cornwell have struggled in new teams and have fallen down the list. Our new methodology has also hurt low-output players like Ryan "⁠Neityu⁠" Aubry and Emil "⁠nota⁠" Moskvitin, who have been playing at a similar level as the first half of the year but lost in tiebreakers to players ahead of them.

Due to the interim ESIC suspension of Anton "⁠Meinz⁠" Evander, we felt it appropriate to replace him on the list, and the obvious candidate was his compatriot Linus "⁠nilo⁠" Bergman.

HEROIC's 20-year-old rifler didn't play in the first season and wasn't featured in our first prospect ranking, but he would have made the list had there been sufficient data based on his career figures in CS2, a 1.17 rating.

Meinz's ban means we can rectify the situation and slot nilo into the ranking without needing to wait for the new Prospect Report #2 list which will come in early 2026.


Only a few players have changed teams since we released the list for the first half of 2025, like Gleb "⁠gr1ks⁠" Gazin to BIG and Nicky "⁠NickyB⁠" Bruhn to Tricked, but given how new this project is it is a good time to take stock of how many players are already stepping through the tiers.

Dive deeper into the prospects data with our interactive stats page
On top of the update to the ranking we've picked four players to put a spotlight on. Sam "Draik" Popkes spoke to one of FUT's three top 50 prospects, dem0n, at CS Asia Championships, and Danish "⁠Nohte⁠" Allana interviewed Inner Circle's Dawy at ESL Pro League Season 22.

Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard took some time to speak with Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda at Thunderpick World Championship before he was benched in OG, and Tomas "⁠tomaszin⁠" Corna hopped on a call where we learned more about BESTIA's rising star in South America.


Quick facts
He broke out at the Shanghai RMR (1.42 rating, even as BESTIA went out 2-3) and has gone up a level in the last three months (1.16 season 1, 1.21 season 2)

Although he rarely leaves his home continent, tomaszin has been solid against top opposition (1.15 rating vs top 30 teams in 70 maps, 2nd only to kyousuke and better than molodoy's 1.14).

He has not played a big event yet, halting progress higher up the list, but was unlucky to miss Austin Major due to visa issues.

He shies away from opening duels more than most young riflers at 19%, which could put him in the tradition of South America's star lurkers (coldzera, KSCERATO, dgt, latto).

He wins 69.2% of his 1on1s, and has 0.86 clutch points per 24 rounds (3rd in the list, behind flayy (1.07) and kashl1d (0.87)).

As is only fitting for an Argentine competitor, tomaszin looks up to Maradona and has photos of him everywhere. But that's football, when it comes to Counter-Strike he doesn't want to play like anyone else. "I want other people to play like me," he says. "It's like that famous saying, 'If I want to be like someone else, then who will want to be like me?'"

tomaszin is a rare hybrid player in a generation of aggressive W enjoyers, but much of his inspiration comes more from legacy and love of the game. "A player who has inspired me as the years go by and still inspires me because of his enthusiasm and his magic is karrigan," tomaszin says. Him and FalleN, who is also doing really well this year with FURIA, and is also a veteran. They still transmit that same inspiration and still have the same hunger to win that he did six or seven years ago when I watched them when I was starting to play the game."

Going further back than when tomaszin first watched some of his favorite players, his first contact with Counter-Strike was through family, an older cousin he would watch play 1.6 for hours on end. He then started playing the game himself in 2010 or 2011 when he was given a laptop. "I was going to school and sometimes my mom would also take me to her work and we'd commute for like an hour," tomaszin recalls. "I'd take my laptop in my backpack and I'd play while she worked. When we got back home I'd keep playing, and when I got back from school I also played. I was always playing, I loved it."

tomaszin didn't make the jump to CS:GO until late 2015 or early 2016, when his mother bought him his first desktop and he learned about CS tournaments and the larger competitive scene. Later in 2016 he followed Argentina's national team as they made it all the way to the final at The World Championships, but the next big spike in tomaszin's development came when everybody was locked down during the Covid pandemic. "I spent literally all day playing," he recalls. "I had a pretty unhealthy routine sleeping at 11 AM, waking up at 6 or 7 PM, and playing all night until I fell asleep in the morning. Then I woke up the next afternoon and did it all over again."

tomaszin's first competitive experience came when he and his TeamSpeak friend group made a team and were temporarily contracted by Huracán, a football club from Argentina that wanted to field a team in La Liga Pro. They played together for three months during the duration of the tournament and then disbanded. It wouldn't be until two years later, in late 2021, that tomaszin would think about competing again. "Furious Gaming and some other teams had approached me," tomaszin says about that period, "I think 9z did as well — I spoke with their coach at the time —, but I told everyone I wasn't interested in competing."

I never stopped believing that I would make a living from CS. I had the plan B in the back of my mind, going back to school to study, but I already knew that wasn't going to be my future
Tomas "⁠tomaszin⁠" Corna
It was upon completing his high school studies that tomaszin really dove in. "I studied law for the first six months of 2022, but I quickly realized that I had picked the wrong career. It wasn't for me," he recalls. "So I said, 'I have six months until the end of the year to get on a team and play professionally — to get paid and be able to live off of Counter-Strike."

The decision to pursue gaming in favor of a law degree caused some friction at home. "My family and my mom didn't really understand this whole Counter-Strike thing," he says, although his mother wasn't unsupportive and had always let him play since childhood without issues. "The arguments were normal for a mother who just wanted to tell their son, 'Study or work, but don't be lazy.' It's understandable."

tomaszin started to play the local PUG leagues and joined Ape Gang, an organizationless team that was decent at the local level but never got any backing. "I was always just trying to make enough time for what I knew was eventually going to come," he recalls. "I never stopped believing that I would make a living from CS. I had the plan B in the back of my mind, going back to school to study, but I already knew that wasn't going to be my future."

The first real professional contract came when his former Ape Gang teammate Matias "⁠pavv⁠" Pavón lobbied to bring him into his new team, Boca Juniors. "It was pretty crazy because how do you explain to somebody who doesn't know Counter-Strike that you're going to be playing for Boca Juniors? It's the most famous football club in Argentina and known around the world," he says.

That's when everything changed, and the discussions at home were no more. "I didn't speak about it with my mother," tomaszin says, "but I guess she went from thinking that I was being lazy and spending all day on the PC to thinking, 'OK, he's actually making some money by sitting in front of the computer all day.'"


"Before they even talked to me or anything, I knew it was my time," tomaszin says of getting the call from BESTIA
By then, tomaszin was already getting some recognition at the local level. Before even joining Boca Juniors, the most tenured captain in Argentina, Nicolás "⁠Noktse⁠" Dávila, had called him to let him know that they had their eye on him."It wasn't like they were trying to sign me or anything, but it was a really helpful chat for me," tomaszin recalls. "I was being recognized for what I had done up to that point, which was basically just playing well."

Three months later, BESTIA announced the benching of Luca "⁠Luken⁠" Nadotti and tomaszin knew his time had come. "Before they even talked to me or anything, I knew it was my time," he says. "I knew that this was another rung on the ladder. It was a top team in the region, not just a good local team, like Boca, where we were good in Argentina but we never got far regionally. This was the next step."

tomaszin took his first weeks on the team as a time to become a sponge and learn from his more experienced teammates. The change in level of competition was notable and there was some inconsistency early on, but he was confident that after the adaptation period he would play well once he had everything figured out. "I was confident in my individual level beyond the knowledge I had at that time, which was pretty rudimentary. The micro and the macro, I just didn't understand the game the way I do now," he says.

"I came into the team with a humble attitude and listening to what everyone had to tell me because they knew more than me, and to learn how they saw everything the way they did," tomaszin recalls, "but bluntly speaking, I knew that once it clicked, once I figured out how everything worked, I was going to play well and carry." And, for the most part, that's how it was going, but some of the biggest lessons tomaszin learned over the past three years in BESTIA came outside of the server.


"First of all I have to respect my work and the work of others because this is a team game, not an individual game," tomaszin says of learning how to become a professional
"What I learned the most — and this is something that Noktse, Pino, and Zote, whom I've been with on the team the longest helped teach me —, was to be a professional and that professionalism and Counter-Strike are a style of life," tomaszin says. "It's about giving your all to get where you want to get and to become who you want to become. It's very easy to get here and say, 'I want to be the best and play on the best team' or whatever, but what really makes a difference is the work behind it, and there's no other secret than work ethic, consistency, and whether the decisions you make match your dreams."

"To be a real professional," tomaszin adds, "first of all I have to respect my work and the work of others because this is a team game, not an individual game. It's hard to be as good as you can be all of the time, but you have to think that if you're not giving your best, you're failing yourself and not being honest with yourself, and on top of that you're affecting the work and dreams of others. You have teammates who also have dreams and are maybe doing all they can to make them come true, and it's a lack of respect if you're not giving everything on your part when the people beside you are."

Of those lessons, the losses leave the biggest marks. "I think it's just part of that self-destructive thing we have as humans," tomaszin says."I don't remember precise moments, but I do remember moments that marked me as a competitor, and it's always the hardest losses, like the Shanghai Major RMR — it was pretty tough and it served me well to grow as a person and mature.

That RMR was a turning point for me because I was calm and played thinking only about the game and not about the situation itself or its importance
Tomas "⁠tomaszin⁠" Corna about his breakout at the Shanghai RMR
"And in Mexico, at my first RMR. It really marked me because I went in with so many expectations. We were fighting Liquid in a best-of-one, almost beating them, 11-11, to losing 0-2 to Wildcard the next day and being eliminated. It was a very sad way of going out. Then in China, when we lost and were out 2-3, just one best-of-three away… It was like, 'OK, at least I now have this experience.'"

The growth between the two RMRs shows tomaszin's evolution in just one year. From not knowing what was coming in Mexico, where he ended his team's 0-2 finish with a 1.01 rating, to a breakthrough performance in China, where he finished with a 1.42 rating in the 2-3 run. The confidence of knowing that he could cut out the noise and perform when the stakes were high shone through.

One on those moments was the 1-2 match in the Shanghai RMR that BESTIA played against BOSS, a three-map series that started with the Argentines losing their map pick in which tomaszin posted a 1.75 rating to keep his team's hopes of qualifying for the Major in China alive.


"Losing the Shanghai RMR was pretty tough because I had the sadness of being eliminated, of being really close to the dream of playing at a Major, but at the same time I was satisfied with my showing on an individual level and I finally felt like I could play to my potential," tomaszin says. "That RMR was a turning point for me because I was calm and played thinking only about the game and not about the situation itself or its importance."

tomaszin has also been refining his game on the server. He's a rare breed among the youngsters coming up, who usually favor a more outwardly aggressive style, but he doesn't want to be boxed into being considered purely passive. "You can't always be closed into a single style and something I've noticed is that I used to be pretty passive in my roles and I was never looking for duels and entries or trying to make space," he says, "but with time I feel like I've become more hybrid in that sense. I can be pretty aggressive one game, change rhythm, and be pretty unpredictable."

tomaszin has generally always put up strong numbers, but he saw that many times, he wasn't feeling his impact on the server. "I didn't feel like a player who was swinging rounds or changing the course of the game," he says. "I knew I was capable of doing it, but because of my style I maybe wasn't putting it into play and that's why in the past year I've realized that I can be a bit more aggressive even if I'm limited by certain roles or positions, so I try to do that."

The image I have in my mind, what I think about before falling asleep, is me lifting a trophy, or the casters in an arena shouting my name when I make a play and everybody is going wild
Tomas "⁠tomaszin⁠" Corna
Players he likes to watch who have similar roles? Ilya "⁠Perfecto⁠" Zalutskiy, when he played for Natus Vincere, for one, and Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, a crucial key in his favorite team of all time, the FaZe of 2022. Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken, too, is a player he mentioned, of course also from that dominant FaZe team. From the new gen, Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets couldn't miss out on the list. "He came in and broke everything," tomaszin says. "He broke all of the records and he's the best rifler since he landed in tier one, without a doubt."


tomaszin has been studying English to make sure that if an offer were ever to come his way, he could jump on it, although he doesn't discard remaining in his team and region if he believes he has a chance to win.

"My goal is to be one of the best players in the world and etch my name into the game's history," he says. "The image I have in my mind, what I think about before falling asleep, is me lifting a trophy, or the casters in an arena shouting my name when I make a play and everybody is going wild. If I stop and think about it, something that would make me happy, is playing in those arenas with that tension and beautiful atmosphere. That's what motivates me to want to win and qualify for those tournaments."


Quick facts
One of three IGLs on the list, Chr1zn falls slightly to 17th after being benched in OG and the team not making the Budapest Major (but also because of breakout talents overtaking).

He briefly tried AWPing in MOUZ NXT and stood in for HEROIC, but is now a rifling IGL happy to sacrifice for the team. 34% of kills come with non-rifle weapons, far more than our two other prospect IGLs, Gizmy (29%) and Krabeni (23%).

0.07 flash assists per round and 0.74 flashes thrown per round also tell a tale, but he does like to control the action on CT in spots like Connector on Mirage or B rotate in Overpass.

Like every young Counter-Strike fan in Denmark between 2017 and 2019, Chr1zN is an Astralis baby. The young Dane got caught in the Astralis wave, a country-wide frenzy when the team was building the dynasty that rewrote how the game was played, won the first Intel Grand Slam, and lifted four Major trophies. But his first love actually lay far from home, in Brazil, and only the notion that one could not cheer for several teams steered him solely towards the Astralis camp.

Chr1zN was first introduced to the game as it is best enjoyed in Odense, Denmark, at the Pro League Season 6 Finals, where he was actually cheering for Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo and SK. "At the time I hadn't really watched a professional game ever, so I don't know why," he says. "For some reason that was the first team I supported. I was an Astralis fan, and an SK fan, you know? Then my dad told me I had to choose one because you can't be fan of two teams. So of course, I ended up going with Astralis."

Astralis were getting pushed by the media and Chr1zN wanted to be like them. "gla1ve had always been my idol for the longest time," Chr1zN says. "I really looked up to him, especially. I think he was very impressive, being the IGL and also being capable of shooting the way he did." But it wasn't just Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, he looked up to all of that Astralis as role models and used wanting to be them as motivation to become a professional.

Chr1zN had gotten into Counter-Strike at around 12 years old through a friend and when he realized that he was getting good, he even prioritized it above his footballing aspirations. Some players start by watching, or playing for fun in community servers or alternate game modes, but the Dane want more than a low-stakes environment. "I've always wanted to win a bit too much, so I tried to get on a team as fast as possible and started playing with my younger brother and sirah, who plays on ECSTATIC now, and some older guys in Denmark."

From there on out, everything went fast. Joining his first team in early 2022, AGF, led to Tricked after just a couple of months, and then to his first feel for an international project at MOUZ NXT by September under the orders of countryman Tobias "⁠TOBIZ⁠" Theo. Two years later he was captaining tier-two side OG, and then after just one more year he started at his first Major in Austin.


Chr1zN was invited to play in front of the Danish crowd at a showmatch during the PGL Copenhagen Major
"Throughout my whole competitive journey I've been steadily climbing, so it has all been very natural," Chr1zN says. "Every time I've had to take a step up, I've kind of done it, which is lucky. A lot of it is timing and knowing the right people."

Chr1zN first had real options after Tricked. He could have decided to stay with them or go on another Danish team, but the lure of joining one of the most prolific academy teams in the world, MOUZ NXT was too strong. "When I got the message from TOBIZ I was a little overexcited," Chr1zN recalls. "It was really big for me back then, and still now, thinking back, it's really impressive for me and something I cherish."

Most of my early understanding was built around the Astralis principles. [...] With time, of course, I've become better and adapted my style
Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard on learning from his idols early on in his journey as an IGL
Joining MOUZ NXT, an international team, opened up a lot of opportunities for Chr1zN, who also got to try out being an IGL for a younger group, which gave him more room for error and space to learn from mistakes since that was expected in the academy environment. An environment created by TOBIZ, who made sure to instill strong fundamentals and give Chr1zN confidence that he was progressing adequately. "That was probably the most important because it gave me the feeling that I was always on the right track," Chr1zN recalls.

"At the start, especially when I was coming up fresh, I hadn't played with anyone IGLing before, so it was just my own thoughts and what I saw from other games," Chr1zN recalls from the early days. "I tried to copy and mimic a lot of the stuff Astralis were doing and with time I kind of opened up my view to other teams, of course, but probably more when I was 14 or 15.

"Most of my early understanding was built around the Astralis principles. Things have to be structured, executes are very important, nades and whatnot, taking map control and stuff. But also, it got enforced a lot because all of the Danish teams we were playing were trying to do the same, so you had to adapt to that, as well. With time, of course, I've become better and adapted my style."

Now, Chr1zN likes to give players a lot of freedom early on and then set boundaries where that freedom ends. "For me, especially, the early-round, people have a lot of stuff they can do and say and we can make it happen, so there's a lot of openness for people to take initiative and have this freedom," he says, "but as soon as we get to the mid-round and late-round I like to micromanage a lot and take control.

"For the longest time, I liked playing defaults because it gave me the opportunity to do this, to have free openers and then I kind of mid-round from there, which I think is my biggest strength, but I also think that with how CS is played now it's probably more important to have some good set strats here and there because there's just not a lot of T rounds going around and you don't have that many full-buys, so when the time is right you really need to make it happen with a fast-paced round or whatever it could be. In that sense, I've shifted my style a bit more into set openers sometimes, but I think it's a good mixture."

Chr1zN briefly went from gla1ve to FalleN, to make the analogy with his childhood heroes, and gave AWPing a go while keeping his duties as a caller. "I had flirted with the idea before we went on break, when we knew it might have been a thing that could happen," Chr1zN says, "and at the time we were playing CS:GO, but it switched to CS2 right as I was going to AWP, and that was not a nice move. AWPing became even harder and I was not that good at it, first of all, so it just limited me way more than I would have thought.


Chr1zN was crucial in OG making it past Stage 1 at the Austin Major as an IGL and a fragger with a 1.29 rating
"Luckily for me, half a year later, we got rid of it, which was good. The big positive that came from it was that I got another perspective of the game, but also I got the chance to stand in for HEROIC, who needed an AWPing IGL, so in that sense I was very lucky that it happened at the same time, but it wasn't a plus for me at the time."

The move to OG in 2024 served to further open Chr1zN's eyes to different ways of working. "We had less games and more time to prepare," he says, "and Lambert kind of taught me another way of making gameplans. TOBIZ laid out all of the fundamentals for me, and we were so eye-to-eye in the way we solved stuff, but Lambert challenged me more in some things, which was really good because I've learned more than I would playing with TOBIZ for more years. It has been really good and I've learned a lot."

At 19, Chr1zN's progression has been rapid from his first matches on HLTV with AGF in early '22 to his stint in MOUZ NXT and a shot at leading a tier-two team before his age 20 season. He already played a Major, averaging a 1.29 rating while leading OG through Stage 1 with a 3-1 record, and got his first taste of victory at the smaller DraculaN Season 1 in Bucharest, Romania, where he beat his former teammate from the very early days and #23 on the prospect ranking, William "⁠sirah⁠" Kjærsgaard .

Chr1zN is now at a crux as OG moved him to the bench with his contract set to expire at the end of the year. When asked about the benching, OG's CEO, Xavier Oswald, did not share anything about the youngster. "Everything is still in process regarding the changes in the team," he said. Reports of Casper "⁠cadiaN⁠" Møller being targeted had already broken at the time and his signing is now official, but the reasoning behind benching the singular prospect went unanswered, a shocking move after Lambert "⁠Lambert⁠" Prigent recently said that they "really want to focus on Chr1zN and work with him."

Regarding his own status on the prospect ranking, Chr1zN is proud to be on the list and confident in his place on it. "It's very new, so I had to understand what it's all about," he says. "I think there are a lot of very good players on there, so to be among those is something I'm proud of. Also, I see myself as a hot prospect, so I think I deserve to be there."


Quick facts
Dawy is a big climber, from 20th to 8th.

He has a 1.21 rating at MVP-worthy events, and a solid 1.14 vs top50 (=2nd highest with molodoy in the list).

A solid pack rifler (23.0% of kills are trades, 23.3% of deaths are traded), he and cairne have fired TNL/Inner Circle into relevancy.

Dawy turned 18 on September 21. On that same day, his TNL lost a three-map series to Betera after dropping a 12-0 lead in the opening map and losing it in overtime. Two weeks later, under the Inner Circle banner, they beat The MongolZ 2-0 at ESL Pro League Season 22. The 18-year-old had 120.2 ADR, +12.72%, and a 2.30 rating in the 13-11 victory on Mirage that ended the game. The MongolZ were the top team on both HLTV's World Ranking and the VRS ranking at the time.


"It's really crazy, you know?" Dawy says. "On September 20 I lost to ESC online and it was the worst game of my career. On September 21 I lost from 12-0 — that was a crazy experience on my birthday —, but then we beat The MongolZ, so it's really crazy in two weeks we went from losing from 12-0 to BETERA to beating The MongolZ. It's really crazy."

That The MongolZ life game wasn't a one-off, either. The 18-year-old has a 1.20 LAN rating and has excelled from his 1.31-rated outing in TNL's breakout first-place finish at Level Up LUND! to a 1.39 in their 13-16th place finish at the most recent Red Bull GIBAWAY JOURNEY.

"I'm really proud of myself, of course, because it was my dream," Dawy says. "Half a year ago I was watching them, these tier one teams, and I was dreaming of playing on this stage like them."

First as DASH, then as TNL, and now as Inner Circle, Dawy and his teammates really have risen the ranks all on their own from top 200 in the VRS in April to playing at ESL Pro League in October. "At first we were playing against like top 200 teams, then top 100 teams, then top 70, and we were all leveling up," Dawy says. "I was just grinding so much and watching a lot of demos, playing a lot of pugs and praccs."

For the young Ukrainian, it's all about believing in himself even in the face of unfavorable odds. "Every second I was believing in myself," he says, "and I know that I can be on a good team, I can beat good teams — I knew that even when I was top 200. Confidence will come if you're beating teams and you have good numbers. You can't have confidence from nothing, you have to start beating some teams."

I was top 20 in this ranking, but I think I'm higher than top 20
David "⁠Dawy⁠" Bibik on being 20th in the initial prospect ranking before moving up to #8
Dawy's love for the game and dedication had been stewing for years. "It was my brother, I'm really happy that he showed me CS," Dawy says. "I was like six-years-old, he was playing CS:S. I was watching him play and it was a really cool game. I started playing with bots, then guys on some public servers."

Now, as he vies to make it in the top echelons of the game, Dawy wants to take the moment to show his gratitude publicly. "Thank you, Vova," he says. "I'm grateful to you for bringing me into this game and for the fact I'm at tier one [level] now, and also thank you, mom and dad, for believing in me."

First, it was a hobby. Then, by age 10 or 11, Dawy started watching top tier tournaments. Before that, though, he had gone to the The National Palace of Arts Ukraina in Kyiv, where StarSeries events used to take place. "I even have a picture with Zeus, Dosia, Magisk — when he was playing in Dignitas and his nickname was Magiskb0Y —, you know? I was watching and I was, like, 'wow, this is really cool, I also want to play on this stage, this arena, this level.'"

By 12, Dawy reached Global Elite and the FACEIT grind started. That's when his grandparents gave him a new PC and he could leave his laptop and the 30 FPS life behind. "And that's when my career started," he says.


Dawy thanked his family for their support when speaking with HLTV for the Prospect Report
So far, he has been impressing enough to become a top 20 prospect, and it hasn't gone unnoticed. "It's really cool that some people, some teams, HLTV, that they know that there's some talent, and I'm really proud of myself for this because some good cybersports mens on Twitter are starting to follow me now and it's really cool," he says. "But, you know, I was top 20 in this ranking, but I think I'm higher than top 20."

Dawy thinks he is better than some of the names above him on the first prospect ranking. Now, he made the jump to the top 10. "I think I proved to some guys and also to HLTV that I can be higher at [EPL Season 22]," he says.

"Honestly, I don't know what it'll be with me and my future," he says, but he knows that the grind won't stop and he believes that there will be more chances to show himself.

"[ESL Pro League was] my first tier-one tournament. I can see the tier-one players live, not on the stream, and I can shake hands with them," he concludes. "I can say hi at the hotel, it's really cool. I want to play more tournaments like this."


Quick facts
Another big climber, from 35th to 18th, after shining for FUT this season.

dem0n is a tad more passive than your average rising CS2 star and 36% of his kills are assisted (98 trading attribute).

Therefore it's no surprise that his doppelganger is a player like Twistzz who has sharp aim (dem0n has 67.5% HS%) and likes to go second or third into sites.

dem0n is a classic younger brother who first learned of Counter-Strike through an older sibling. That was when he was eight years old, and by nine he got his first PC and started on his own journey. Four years later, at 13, he joined NAVI's youth program. "It was unexpected because at that time it was not really normal to sign young players," dem0n says. "As I remember, the youngest guy to join was m0NESY, he was 14. I was kind of proud because I can call myself the youngest at that age."

dem0n spent time in all tiers of NAVI's development program: NAVI Academy, NAVI Youth, and NAVI Junior. At first, just shadowing those who were there before him. "I was in TeamSpeak with m0NESY, headtr1ck, and I was just spectating how they were playing," he says, "but I don't remember much from that time."

Things started to ramp up in 2023, when he was called up to NAVI Junior alongside the likes of Aulon "⁠Krabeni⁠" Fazlija and Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri, but it was in 2025 when the team really started to come into its own, so much so that they became too good to stay as an academy team under the Natus Vincere banner.


FUT has three prospects, including dem0n, and the team's average age is below 19
makazze got called up to the main team when Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius decided to step down, and the rest of the Junior squad was bought out by FUT. "I'm not really disappointed because I know that makazze was the first priority and not me, for sure," dem0n says of not continuing through the pipeline in Natus Vincere all the way to the first team. "And at that time I was kind of having some confidence problems, so I didn't feel sure that I would get an invite to a tier-one team, but in the end, I like what happened now."

What happened now is that FUT are 30th in the HLTV World Ranking and 40th in the VRS Global Ranking. They finished in 5-6th place at their biggest event to date, the CS Asia Championships and are knocking at the doors of reaching top-tier events.

dem0n is the highlighted player in this update, but two of his teammates, Džiugas "⁠dziugss⁠" Steponavičius and Krabeni, are also on the prospect ranking. The team is just 18.9 years old on average and the most experienced player, Laurențiu "⁠lauNX⁠" Țârlea, is having a second youth at the tender age of 20.


Now, dem0n is working on his confidence and it's showing. "[It's] my problem since I have played big CS, from 13 years-old, when I just joined the game, so I'm kind of working on it. Right now I feel better, for sure," he says, and adds that "after showing good individual performances I would say that I should be a little bit higher [on the ranking]." From 35th on the list, he has now entered the top 20.

"I don't like to have any expectations, but for sure I just want to keep up this level where I'm at right now to keep playing these kinds of tournaments," he concludes. "It's a really enjoyable time visiting big cities, big hotels, and everything is enjoyable, so I should just play better."

dem0n has has emerged as the team's best player since losing makazze with a 1.16 rating since joining FUT and recently posted a solid 1.11 at CAC, trailing only fellow prospect dziugss's 1.12 in China. As FUT have started to get more exposure, the "he really is a dem0n" puns have started to rear their head, and don't expect them to stop anytime soon.

"I hope at the Major we will be able to show the CS we're building," the Spirit coach said.


Spirit made it out of Group A at BLAST Rivals following a 2-0 victory over The MongolZ, bouncing back from the opening day's defeat to Falcons — their third consecutive loss to Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski's troops.

It's been a challenging couple of months for the Russian team, who have found it hard to integrate Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich into their system after having already made a change this season when they brought Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin in for Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev.

Questioned about the team's recent struggles, Sergey "⁠hally⁠" Shavaev conceded that two changes in the space of two months "is quite much."

"He [tN1R] joined the team during the rebuild and not during our peak," he told HLTV. "If he had joined us during the peak, I think it would have been easier for him."

As Spirit prepare for the playoffs, hally admits that the focus is on Budapest. "For us, both Chengdu and Hong Kong are preparation events for the Major," he said. "I hope at the Major we will be able to show the CS we're building,"

Note: The answers were given in Russian and translated into English by HLTV.

You've got revenge over The MongolZ here and you're through to the playoffs. There was a lot of frustration shown yesterday, so how did you reset?

Regarding the game with The MongolZ, the last time we didn't have time to prepare, I believe it played a key role. Meanwhile, I can also say that we're in a suboptimal condition, and we're looking for ways to go back.

For us, both Chengdu and Hong Kong are preparation events for the Major. We try to change our approach and find our game, because now it doesn't look so reliable and consistent. I estimate the team is ranked the way it actually is. It is in our power to change it and come to the Major with a higher level of play.

You lost to Falcons in Chengdu and again here at BLAST Rivals. NiKo and m0NESY are also 9-0 vs the Spirit core. What is it about that duo that gives you so much trouble?

(laughs) Yes, it's true, we're going 0-9 with them. I think they understand the way we play in the attack well. We tried changing certain details, but it didn't work. But I can say that there's a mental aspect to it, and I think it's more important than the game part.

In many moments of these nine games, we couldn't finish off a map where we had situations like yesterday, when we were 11-11 in a 5v4, we found an entry on Long and had a '3 B' call. The moment they walk out, the grenade falls right in front. Things like this happen.

Going back to Chengdu, it wasn't Spirit's best performance. You struggled against HEROIC and lost to The MongolZ. What went wrong?

I believe that in the last half a year, since Andrey joined, we haven't had a lot of in-game practice, also two changes within two months is quite much. I hope at the Major we will be able to show the CS we're building.

It's perhaps justified in places. But you can also see what results I have with the young roster, and I do not devalue my work
Sergey "⁠hally⁠" Shavaev on criticism of his work
You said in Spirit's VLOG that after the loss to FaZe at EPL, some moments gave you a reason to think about your approach, and you had a freer and lighter schedule in Chengdu. Was this new approach a problem? Is there anything you're changing coming here?

No, after the loss to FaZe, we had multiple days off and practiced intensively for Chengdu. We tried to come in at our maximum for this event, and meanwhile, try new things that are not working.

Tell me about tN1R's development this season. You said you can't compare tN1R with zont1x, with their different roles, so what has the process been in making that adjustment in the team?

Regarding Andrey, he has experience in different roles in past teams, so it's easier for him to adapt to new things. Meanwhile, if you look at the structure of our team, it's different from the teams that he had played for before. So it's important for him to gain [experience] as not a lot of time has passed.

Also, it happened so that besides EPL we've had only two events for practice, and with more officials, it's going to get easier for him. And also, he joined the team during the rebuild and not during our peak. If he had joined us during the peak, I think it would have been easier for him.


hally says tN1R needs time to adapt to the team's system
There have been conversations by the community about your impact on the team, with some questioning your ability to make this roster work. Do you think that criticism is deserved or valid, and how would you answer to that?

Regarding the criticism, it's perhaps justified in places. But you can also see what results I have with the young roster, and I do not devalue my work. I believe that in this team, all six people matter, while losses are my responsibility to a higher degree.

You've talked about what tN1R and zweih bring before, but the loss of zont1x and magixx must have also created some holes in the team. What is the team missing now that they brought, and how are you working to address that?

Regarding losing zont1x and magixx, it's a question of balance. magixx was a player who cleans up in the voice, he played with bad weapons, he played the toughest positions. zweih came in with a higher firepower, but for him to play like such a player, he needs a lot of time.

As for Andrey, he's similar to zont1x in terms of positions, but he needs more actions on the map than zont1x. And for that, you need those actions to happen. We're playing with such a player for the first time, so we need time to see how he adapts to this.

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
13:58:40 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13:58:40 | INFO     | **Risk Level:** High, driven by the confirmed instability of blue-chip asset Team Spirit and the potential overvaluation of top prospects like *molodoy* following his recent MVP hype.

**Financial Analysis:** The sharp decline of prospect *zweih* combined with Spirit's admitted "suboptimal condition" signals a bearish trend for their stickers, while the market has likely already priced in the success of rising stars like *molodoy* and *tomaszin*, leaving little room for short-term profit.

**Recommendation:** **Sell** Spirit and *zweih* inventory immediately to mitigate losses, and avoid buying into the current prospect hype cycle.

rain signs for 100 Thieves

rain has a new home after nearly 10 years with FaZe.


100 Thieves have officially signed Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, making the Norwegian the team's first signing upon their return to Counter-Strike. The news confirms a recent report by Dust2.dk.

Media: rain signs for 100 Thieves
"I have found a new home in 100 Thieves and a new and exciting challenge is about to start," rain said in a post on X. "A lot of work to be done but will do everything I can to get back to the top!"

It is currently unclear who will join rain on 100 Thieves to fill out the roster. CS insider Aleksei "⁠OverDrive⁠" Birukov recently reported that the organization was targeting GamerLegion's core, and whilst GamerLegion's CEO acknowledged a conversation was had with 100 Thieves, he said there were "no active discussions about selling any players or core."

The move marks rain's first new team since January 2016 when he first joined FaZe. During his nearly 10-year stint on FaZe he won numerous trophies including a Major, an Intel Grand Slam, and was names on HLTV's Top 20 Players list multiple times.

The tenured rifler was recently moved to the bench by FaZe to make room for the shock return of Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken. It is not clear what role rain will undertake on 100 Thieves, but in his statement following his benching by FaZe he indicated a willingness to move into the IGL role.


Vitality edge Spirit in OT thriller to reach Rivals semi-finals

The apEX-led squad will face Falcons in the semis on Saturday.


Vitality make it four out of four against Spirit in 2025
Vitality and Spirit squared off in the BLAST Rivals Season 2 quarter-finals in their first match since the summer break, with the international squad leading 3-0 in head-to-head matches since the beginning of the year.

This time around, Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut and company were taken to the brink to improve their record against Spirit to 4-0 and secure a spot in the semis against Falcons, as they had to win two maps in overtime after losing the opener 11-13.

The match kicked off on Spirit's Dust2 pick, and the seeds for an exciting series were planted from the start after a chaotic first pistol round ended with a Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets teamkill and the clock expiring. Vitality took advantage and got off to a 5-1 lead, but Spirit activated to bring it even at the half, spearheaded by Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich.

In the end, though, it was donk and Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov who topped the board with 1.32 and 1.31 ratings, respectively, with the former getting three opening kills in the final round of regulation to edge the map in Spirit's favor, 13-11.

Nuke was an equally tight map with plenty of highlights going both ways. The most crucial was a highlight-of-the-year contender by donk, who clutched a 1vs5 with a Galil when up against map point to get his team into overtime.

It was in vain in the end as two overtimes later Vitality won 19-16 to take the series to the Mirage decider as the Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin and Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov duo struggled on the CT side and even donk's attempts to assist on the A site didn't bear fruit.

Like the two first maps, the decider went down to the wire. Once again Vitality got an early jump with a 6-1 lead on the CT side, but donk multi-kills got Spirit clawing back all the way back to 10-10.

"donk is a lot, but not always enough," is how Conner "⁠Scrawny⁠" Girvan put it after Vitality won a a dominating A execute to hit map point on the Mirage decider, but Spirit fought back to force overtime with a beautiful triple hold on A by zweih, who had been faltering up to that point.

Finally, Vitality kicked into gear in extra rounds winning three in a row and positioning themselves to take the series, which they did two rounds after the switch to secure their progression in Hong Kong.

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
14:00:33 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:00:33 | INFO     | The market presents **Moderate Risk** characterized by high speculative volatility due to 100 Thieves' re-entry into the ecosystem and the supply cap placed on Rain's decade-long history of FaZe autographs. Fundamental analysis suggests an immediate value spike for Rain's "golden era" FaZe stickers due to scarcity, while Donk's elite statistical performance (1.26 rating) insulates Spirit assets from depreciation despite their tournament exit. **Buy** Rain (FaZe) and vintage 100 Thieves stickers to capitalize on the roster-change hype, and **Hold** Donk assets as his individual metrics sustain market demand.

14:01:32 | INFO     | The market is currently bifurcated, with legacy tournament stickers showing bullish volume on scarcity fundamentals while the rumored case release introduces deflationary pressure on general liquidity. We assess the risk level as **Moderate-High**, as historical trends suggest a temporary market-wide sell-off whenever new content draws capital away from existing assets. Therefore, the recommendation is to **Hold** high-tier vintage stickers to weather the volatility, but prepare cash reserves to **Buy** the inevitable dip if the new case is confirmed.

ESC have parted ways with their Counter-Strike team, which has been acquired by an unspecified organization, it was announced on Saturday.

The transfer comes almost a year after ESC landed the los kogutos roster. The team has won several online tournaments in the last six months, including one CCT Series, two Winline Insight seasons, and the recent ESL Challenger League Season 50 Europe Cup 3.

The Polish roster is currently ranked 42nd in the global VRS ahead of the ESL Challenger League Season 50 Europe Finals — in which a Pro League spot will be on offer — and DraculaN 3 in Bucharest. In both tournaments, the team will play under FriendlyCampers, a temporary name until the transfer to the new organization is completed.

"My time at ESC was really great," Patryk "⁠olimp⁠" Woźniak told HLTV. "After a year with Rebels, they contacted me, offered me the role of IGL, and I accepted. The team itself is great, there's a good atmosphere. The only problem was that ESC couldn't provide us with what was most important: LAN.

"Then another organization came along that wanted to buy us out, and it was the perfect moment. We are very happy about this because we will finally have the chance to appear at offline events. ESC simply couldn't afford it.

"The organization that bought us out is great and can provide us with this, and we will finally be able to play in LANs, so that people will no longer comment that we are only online players.

"We would like to thank ESC very much for their time and for all their support, because apart from that, the CEOs are great people and were always at our disposal. I will have very fond memories of this time and the boot camp with these people. Best regards, Franky and Christian!"

ESC had the following squad:

Poland Patryk "⁠olimp⁠" Woźniak
Poland Kamil "⁠reiko⁠" Cegiełko
Poland Dawid "⁠SaMey⁠" Stańczak
Poland Wojciech "⁠bajmi⁠" Strzelczyk
Poland Bartosz "⁠moonwalk⁠" Mikołajczyk

FURIA win fourth straight clash against Falcons to lift BLAST Rivals trophy

FURIA add a fourth trophy to their cabinet since the summer break.


FURIA continue to be Falcons' black beast after beating them for a fourth consecutive time after a group stage victory at IEM Cologne and two semi-final bouts at FPG 2 and IEM Chengdu. This time, it was to win the BLAST Rivals Season 2 grand final, 3-1, in one of the most exciting series of the year.

This victory marks FURIA's fourth title run since adding Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis to the team with victories at FPG2, TWC 2025, and IEM Chengdu, and puts them in the elite group of teams contending to challenge for the crown at the looming Major in Budapest.

The first map, Inferno, was a landslide for Falcons, who stole it 13-3 to take the series lead, and it came off the back of the work of Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski, who amidst a stacked lineup full of firepower posted his best-ever map rating, a 2.54, leading from the trenches with two clutches and seven multi-kill rounds.



kyxsan clutches 1vs3 in pistols

If Inferno was kyxsan's playground, YEKINDAR stamped his name on Nuke as FURIA struck right back with a 13-9 victory on Falcons' first pick to tie the series up. The Latvian went nuclear on Cedar Creek with a 21-3 scoreline in the 10 rounds on the T side and an off-the-charts 4.06 rating with +29.83% round wing.



YEKINDAR 4K tears apart Falcons' lower defense, granting his team map point

"That was a reference map to how good this version of Train can play," is how Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg put it on X when talking about the third map in the series. "[I] still don't think it's a top tier map nor do most teams play it to that level, but that was incredibly entertaining."

Indeed, the series amped up and delivered an exciting double-overtime affair which went 19-15 to FURIA, with molodoy swinging some crucial rounds including two quad-kills in overtime as the two teams fought tooth and nail to take the series lead and get within one map victory of lifting the trophy.


molodoy finishes 4K with 1v1 clutch vs. m0NESY

Falcons were do or die on their Mirage pick and they got off to a 4-0 start, but molodoy became a fragging machine with the AWP on the CT side and helped his team to a 7-5 lead at the half with multi-kill after multi-kill.

FURIA's individual heroics, which included a crucial clutch by Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato in an unlikely 1vs4, were met with strong play by Falcons, who held their own to force another overtime.


KSCERATO pulls off impossible 1v4

Three straight on the defense by Falcons made a strong argument for there to be a fifth map, but FURIA answered back with three of their own, including from a 4v5 situation in the final round with no molodoy, to force a second OT.

Despite Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov going nuclear in a 2v5 situation to get Falcons ahead, the kyxsan-led squad fell behind and FURIA won out from there with four straight rounds, two on either side of the half, to make it 19-16 and lift the trophy in Hong Kong.

m0NESY earns another losing MVP at BLAST Rivals

m0NESY repeats the difficult feat of earning an MVP award despite finishing second, after doing so at ESL Pro League Season 22.


Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov has picked up his second HLTV x 1XBET Most Valuable Player (MVP) award of the year at BLAST Rivals Season 2, once again earning the award despite being on the losing side of the grand final.

FURIA win fourth straight clash against Falcons to lift BLAST Rivals trophy
Although he lost in the final m0NESY was the clear standout player throughout the tournament, leading the rating charts by a long way with 1.42 over 10 maps to bag the sixth MVP award of his career.

The Russian sniper topped a plethora of stats categories with the top rating (1.42), impact rating (1.51), round swing (5.15%), and kills per round (0.89) just to name a few.

m0NESY did not let up in a losing effort in the grand final either, co-leading his team with a 1.30 rating and server-leading 91 kills and 4.00% swing.

FURIA had MVP candidates of their own, Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato chief among them, but ultimately FURIA spread the carrying across four of their players and as such, didn't have a clear leading player to potentially snatch the award from m0NESY.


m0NESY on MVP: "It hurts more than winning it at EPL because [we] had a lot of chances"

m0NESY feels Falcons were forced into mistakes which cost them the trophy at BLAST Rivals.


Falcons are a team on an upward trajectory, as evidenced by their recent strong of top-four finishes. Sadly for Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov and company they were once again second-best at BLAST Rivals, losing in a hard-fought grand final to FURIA.

"How we didn't close Mirage," m0NESY responded when asked for his thoughts. "It feels sad to lose these games, especially when you had the feeling that you potentially could go to the last map."

Despite suffering defeat in the final m0NESY walked away from the tournament with the HLTV x 1XBET MVP award, much like he did at ESL Pro League. He said this time the loss hurt more than in Sweden.

"[At ESL Pro League] you're just losing 3-0 and you didn't do anything on the server. You just lost 3-0 and you went home. I was even smiling. But right now it just hurts more because you knew you had a lot of chances."

m0NESY spoke with HLTV after his valiant grand final effort to talk about Falcons' run in Hong Kong and their recent uptick, as well as his own return to form.


You can listen to the full interview here.

Heart-breaking grand final, an incredible grand final, but I know you're incredibly sad after that because you couldn't get it over the line. Tell me what's going through your mind right now.

How we didn't close Mirage. How we didn't close it. We had three chances, we got three chances to close it on T side and we didn't. I died two times, I gave up first kill, I'm kind of responsible for that. It feels sad to lose these games, especially when you had the feeling that you potentially could go to the last map.

When you got your last MVP at EPL, you were sad with second place. Here it's second place again, but overall Falcons and you have really improved in the last couple of months in the warmup to the Major. It has been a steady incline. What do you think you need to get it over the line right now?

First of all, in the final at ESL Pro League Vitality was one step ahead of us, they were a much stronger opponent, a much stronger team than us at ESL Pro League. But coming to this tournament we prepared a lot.

I feel like FURIA forced us to make a lot of mistakes in this final and we lost a lot of stupid situations
Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov
In my opinion, we improved as a team so much that we could potentially fight and be contenders for the trophy, but coming into this game, to the grand final, the team who makes more mistakes will lose. I feel like FURIA forced us to make a lot of mistakes in this final and we lost a lot of stupid situations that you cannot lose if you want to lift the trophy. There were a lot of 5v3s, 4v2s, on a lot of maps, and if you want to lift the trophy you cannot lose these stupid rounds.

You guys clawed back a couple, and they won a bunch as well. The big turning point here had to be that KSCERATO 1v4. Can you tell me what was going on in the comms during that round?

I don't remember what happened specifically before the 1v2, but I was left in a 1v2 with TeSeS. After we cleared Ninja, because I took the Molotov from Stairs, I told René [TeSeS]... He wanted me to come Bench with him, but I said that I was going to take the Molotov instead and Molly Ninja. We cleared Ninja, we cleared Default, we cleared Firebox, but there was one guy hiding in Sandwich, his name is KSCERATO... and I just didn't know he could be there because I thought my teammate cleared him. It's not his fault, it's just a fault in the communication. In this situation we have to chill and have good comms, but he played well. He played well.

Obviously sometimes maybe you cannot get some kills, but I feel like he was always with us and there was no minuses from him
Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov on NiKo's performance
You came into the grand final swinging. You won Inferno. First of all, did you expect to start on Inferno at all?

I didn't expect anything coming into this match. I just knew that we could be stronger than them in a lot of situations, especially on Inferno because we put a lot of work into this map. We wanted to become better on this map, but there are other maps you have to work on, you know? I think we were strong today, but not enough. We made more mistakes than them, they played better in situations than us, and they deserve this trophy and we don't.

As a big topic throughout this series on the cast and the analyst desk, NiKo had a really rough series, especially at the start of Mirage. Can you tell me what was going wrong? What was the situation like on the server?

I didn't feel that NiKo had a rough start. I don't know how he played. In my opinion, he played very well this game. He was calling as our second captain on the CT side and he has to always be vocal, so I didn't feel any... I don't know how to say it in English, but he didn't fall down in this game, you know? He was there with us, he was playing. Obviously sometimes maybe you cannot get some kills, but I feel like he was always with us and there was no minuses from him. Maybe, of course, he would get some frags, but other players could also get them. Sometimes it happens, it's fine, it happens to the best players.

As a team we're going to lift the next trophies, I'm not worried about that. I'm only worried if we're going to continue losing these advantageous situations
Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov
Lastly, we talked about this at EPL as well, but you've really come back to form. This MVP, you were far and away the favorite to win it before the final and as the final went on. Can you tell me how it feels — I'm sure it's hearbreaking right now — to be back in this form as the Major rolls around now?

First of all, it hurts more than winning it at ESL Pro League, the MVP, because you're just losing 3-0 and you didn't do anything on the server. You just lost 3-0 and you went home. I was even smiling. But right now it just hurts more because you knew you had a lot of chances.

On Train, and especially on Mirage, I feel like I started playing much better individually, I had a feeling for the game. I feel like I'm back on the server, I'm back in shape, and I feel like I became even much better as a player, but I still need to get a lot of experience to become even better.

As a team we're going to lift the next trophies, I'm not worried about that. I'm only worried if we're going to continue losing these advantageous situations on the server because these kinds of things sometimes you cannot control, but you have to be always focused in the server.

14:02:27 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:02:27 | INFO     | The risk level is **Moderate to High**, driven by the immediate speculative volatility surrounding ESC's exit from the ecosystem and the resulting supply shock to their legacy inventory. ESC's dissolution creates a classic scarcity play as their existing stickers become finite assets, offering higher short-term upside than the stable, performance-based appreciation of FURIA's recent dominance. **Buy ESC** stickers aggressively to capitalize on the "discontinued organization" premium, while maintaining a **Hold** position on m0NESY and FURIA assets as reliable blue-chip investments heading into the Major cycle.

Short: Nodios announces break from competition

Magnus "⁠Nodios⁠" Olsen has announced that he is taking an indefinite career break "due to the recent circumstances."

He said that, for legal reasons, he is unable to share more information about the past few months. His second Tricked stint came to an end on October 1, when his contract was terminated.

"There has simply been more happening behind the scenes than most people get to see," he added.

Short: messioso hints 100T won't be NA-focused
"My championing of NA was very much tied to Complexity and the brand/roster we were building," Graham "⁠messioso⁠" Pitt, 100 Thieves' new Head of CS Operations, said in response to a fan speculating on the organization's new roster.

"While I think that having a strong NA region is important for the health of the global CS ecosystem, it's not going to be something that drives player signings here at 100T unless the player is genuinely who we want for what they bring on the server."

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
14:03:48 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:03:48 | INFO     | The market currently presents **Moderate-High** risk as liquidity rotates out of older collections in anticipation of the upcoming StarLadder Budapest Major, further compounded by restrictive broadcast guidelines that may dampen community-driven demand spikes. While specific speculation on Lynn Vision following their Perfect World victory and 'rain' joining 100 Thieves offers niche opportunities, the broader market is in a pre-tournament consolidation phase. Therefore, the recommendation is to **Hold** existing blue-chip assets to avoid selling into the pre-Major dip, while accumulating liquid capital to deploy once the Budapest sticker designs are revealed.

>>> [STEP 3] INVENTORY SCORING
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring 100 Thieves: Score: 92, Price: 1719.00, Reason: 管理层透露建队方针不局限于北美，暗示将打造国际纵队，这种“未知且强大”的预期叠加Rain的明星效应，使得其存量印花继续受到资本追捧。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 90, Price: 1499.00, Reason: 作为100 Thieves复出后的首位基石选手，其转会带来的轰动效应仍在持续，叠加新东家的高关注度，印花保持高热度。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring jks: Score: 25, Price: 268.00, Reason: 100 Thieves高管messioso明确表示新阵容不会以北美为重心，且只字未提jks，随着Rain的签约和建队方向的明晰，jks回归的炒作预期已近乎破灭。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FURIA: Score: 99, Price: 214.44, Reason: 在BLAST Rivals决赛3-1击败Falcons夺冠，达成惊人的四连冠成就，战队处于绝对统治地位，印花市场情绪极度亢奋，是当前最强标的。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring cadiaN: Score: 65, Price: 24.99, Reason: 转会OG的消息已被市场充分消化，今日无新动态，热度随赛事结束自然回落至平稳区间。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Vitality: Score: 80, Price: 25.00, Reason: 在BLAST Rivals止步半决赛，虽有银河战舰阵容加持，但风头完全被夺冠的FURIA盖过，短期内狂热情绪有所降温，回归理性看多。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 70, Price: 78.70, Reason: 旧部Rain已离队，NiKo所在的Falcons获亚军，FaZe自身处于阵容调整后的沉寂期，市场情绪中性偏谨慎。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Spirit: Score: 38, Price: 23.59, Reason: 早早出局且近期表现缺乏说服力，在FURIA四连冠的强势表现映衬下，Spirit显得竞争力不足，短期看空。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 20, Price: 0.02, Reason: 赛事已结束，作为早早出局的队伍，在当前冠军出炉、转会流言四起的环境中已无存在感。
14:04:20 | INFO     |     -> Scoring ESC: Score: 95, Price: 284.49, Reason: 俱乐部正式官宣告别CS阵容，原班人马被收购并改名参赛。这意味着ESC品牌将暂时或永久退出胶囊池，典型的“绝版”预期瞬间引爆市场抢筹与收藏热度。

14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 88, Price: 1499.00, Reason: 作为100 Thieves复兴的门面人物，其印花与俱乐部热度深度绑定，受整体看多老款/回归概念的带动，热度依然在线。
14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring jks: Score: 20, Price: 268.00, Reason: 100 Thieves管理层明确表示不局限于北美/澳洲体系，且毫无签约传闻，回归预期的破灭导致其印花彻底失去炒作动力。
14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FURIA: Score: 90, Price: 216.80, Reason: 四连冠的统治力毋庸置疑，但利好已兑现，在市场情绪混合的情况下，部分资金可能止盈，但基本面依然极强。
14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring cadiaN: Score: 60, Price: 25.00, Reason: 转会OG已成旧闻，缺乏新的催化剂，随大盘情绪进入平稳期。

14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 68, Price: 78.70, Reason: Rain离队和Twistzz回归的消息已被消化，目前处于阵容磨合的空窗期，市场关注度一般。
14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Spirit: Score: 35, Price: 23.60, Reason: 近期战绩糟糕且早早出局，市场对其信心不足，在混合的市场情绪中属于被抛弃的标的。
14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 15, Price: 0.02, Reason: 缺乏战绩支撑，无新闻曝光，在当前的新老交替和绝版炒作热潮中完全被边缘化。
14:04:52 | INFO     |     -> Scoring ESC: Score: 98, Price: 284.49, Reason: 战队被收购、品牌退出CS赛场的利好持续发酵，叠加今日“老款赛事印花交易量增加”的市场简报，ESC作为最新的“绝版”概念股，正处于资金抢筹的风口浪尖。
14:04:52 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:05:18 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 决策基于以下几点：1. 市场情绪极度乐观（95/100），且新闻明确指出'老款锦标赛印花'交易量正在增加，这直接利好100 Thieves这类绝版/稀有印花。2. 当前亏损仅为1.15%，属于正常市场波动，此时卖出将锁定亏损并损失交易手续费。3. 分析师报告建议'持有'以利用稀缺资产的上涨势头（Flight to quality），对抗新箱子传闻带来的流动性风险。鉴于资产属性与当前资金流向相符，建议继续持有等待反弹。

Consequently, I recommend a **Hold** position to capitalize on the momentum of legacy items while preserving liquidity to react to the confirmed impact of the rumored update.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit, so you must decide if the minor 1.15% decline warrants cutting your loss.
14:05:46 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 尽管当前浮亏严重（-18.97%），但建议继续持有等待反弹。理由如下：1. 市场情绪评分极高（88/100），表明市场整体看多，当前的急跌可能属于超卖，存在技术性反弹需求。2. 你的持仓仅7天，正处于短期波动的剧烈期，此时割肉将实实在在锁定近20%的损失。3. 分析师报告明确建议‘持有’，并指出资金正流向‘老款锦标赛印花’以寻求避险（Flight to quality），rain作为知名老将的印花属于此类受益资产。4. 新箱子传闻带来的恐慌性抛售可能已体现在当前跌幅中，继续杀跌风险大于持有风险。

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently down 18.97%, taking profit is impossible, so you would be cutting losses if you choose to sell now.
14:06:42 | INFO     |     -> Decision for jks: SELL, Reason: 建议止损卖出。理由如下：1. 市场情绪评分极低（20/100），显示市场对该资产极度恐慌或缺乏兴趣，与前两个案例的高情绪形成鲜明对比，暗示短期内缺乏反弹动力。2. 尽管分析师建议持有'老款'资产，但jks作为选手印花，在面临'新箱子发布传闻'带来的流动性吸血效应时，往往比顶级战队Logo更脆弱。3. 目前亏损幅度为6.94%，尚在可控范围内。考虑到极低的情绪分预示着进一步下跌的风险，此时'截断亏损'（Cut Loss）并保留现金（Liquidity）以等待新箱子落地后的更低入场点是更理性的选择。

>>> [STEP 3] INVENTORY SCORING
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring 100 Thieves: Score: 97, Price: 1719.00, Reason: 作为刚刚回归且存量稀缺的顶级潮牌，精准命中“老款赛事印花交易量增加”的市场热点，叠加Rain加盟的余热，是当前市场最强的炒作主线之一。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 89, Price: 1499.00, Reason: 作为100 Thieves复兴的门面人物，其印花价值与俱乐部热度深度绑定，受老款印花整体行情的带动，继续维持高热度。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FURIA: Score: 88, Price: 203.40, Reason: 四连冠的统治级表现构筑了极高的价格底部，但在资金分流至绝版印花炒作和新箱子预期的背景下，短期爆发力减弱，转为高位横盘。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring cadiaN: Score: 55, Price: 23.00, Reason: 转会OG的红利已完全耗尽，无后续话题支撑，且市场资金正流向更有炒作潜力的绝版印花，关注度进一步回落。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Vitality: Score: 76, Price: 24.46, Reason: 拥有ZywOo和ropz的银河战舰具备长期价值，但在缺乏赛事和新闻刺激的空窗期，受新箱子传闻吸血效应影响，热度随大盘震荡整理。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 65, Price: 78.70, Reason: 处于阵容剧变后的平静期，市场观望情绪浓厚，在当前“炒作老款”的市场风向下，缺乏足够的吸引力。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Spirit: Score: 32, Price: 25.00, Reason: 近期战绩低迷，且在混合的市场情绪中，弱势资产最易遭受新箱子传闻带来的资金抽离打击，看空情绪主导。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 15, Price: 0.02, Reason: 既无战绩支撑也无绝版概念，在当前热点频出的市场中被彻底遗忘，流动性枯竭。
14:07:35 | INFO     |     -> Scoring ESC: Score: 99, Price: 500.00, Reason: 战队解散导致的“绝版”属性，完美契合今日市场简报中“老款赛事印花交易量增加”的趋势，成为资金抢筹的绝对核心，热度爆表。
14:07:35 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:08:07 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议坚定持有。理由如下：1. 市场情绪评分高达97/100，比昨日进一步提升，显示市场对该资产的信心极强，买盘意愿高涨。2. 分析师报告明确指出，资金正在向'稀缺的老款资产'（Scarce legacy assets）聚集，以对冲新箱子传闻带来的波动风险，100 Thieves印花正属于此类受益的防御性资产。3. 尽管有新箱子传闻，但当前-1.15%的微小浮亏仅代表横盘整理，此时卖出不仅没有规避风险，反而会白白损失交易手续费。4. 策略上应顺应'老款印花交易量激增'的趋势，等待避险资金进一步推升价格。

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently displaying a divergence where capital is consolidating into scarce legacy assets to hedge against the volatility introduced by the rumored content drop. Consequently, the risk level is **moderate**, as a confirmed new case release typically triggers a short-term liquidity drain and price depression across the broader market. **Hold** your positions in older tournament stickers to capitalize on the current volume surge, while maintaining liquid reserves to buy potential dips if the rumors materialize.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       You cannot take profit since the position is currently at a loss, and the minor 1.15% decline suggests holding is likely preferable to cutting losses.
14:08:38 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 尽管当前面临约19%的严重浮亏，且价格分析部分建议考虑止损，但综合市场深度数据，建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 情绪与价格背离：虽然价格深跌，但情绪评分极高（89/100）且比昨日略有提升，这通常是典型的'超卖'信号，表明市场认为当前价格被低估，存在强烈的反弹预期。2. 宏观对冲逻辑：分析师报告明确指出资金正在流向'稀缺老款资产'以对冲新箱子风险，rain作为老将印花符合这一'Flight to quality'（质量为王）的资金流向。3. 拒绝低位割肉：价格相比昨日未进一步下跌，显示在1499价位有支撑，此时卖出将锁定最大化亏损，不如利用当前的高情绪博取估值修复。

       Since you are currently at a loss of nearly 19%, taking profit is impossible, so you should consider cutting your loss to prevent further downside.

Media: Chr1zN set to join HEROIC
MIRAA
20-11-2025 20:04
The Danish IGL is reportedly on the brink of joining a new team after a month on the bench.


Chr1zN is reportedly replacing LNZ as HEROIC's IGL
OG benched IGL Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard is close to joining HEROIC to replace Linus "⁠LNZ⁠" Holtäng as the team's new skipper, according to a report from Sheep Esports.

Chr1zN was moved to the bench in October alongside Nico "⁠nicoodoz⁠" Tamjidi as the team decided to shake things up after missing out on a spot at the Budapest Major. OG went on to sign Casper "⁠cadiaN⁠" Møller, who is returning to the combined role of AWP and IGL that has brought him much success in the past.

LNZ has been with HEROIC since January, when the Norwegian organization signed Sangal's core. The team won the MESA Nomadic Masters Spring and advanced to Stage 2 of the Austin Major, but recent results have been mixed — a run of form that culminated in the team failing to enter the qualification zone for the Budapest Major.

The view from the wrong side of the Major invite cut-off
On HEROIC, Chr1zN will reunite with Tobias "⁠TOBIZ⁠" Theo, who coached him during his nearly two-year spell on MOUZ NXT.

HEROIC have yet to make a decision on Alimzhan "⁠Alkaren⁠" Bitimbay, who joined the team in August on loan from Spirit. The 18-year-old AWPer has struggled for form at the highest level, averaging a 1.03 rating while with the team.

Should Chr1zN's transfer go through, HEROIC will have:

Denmark Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard
Sweden Linus "⁠nilo⁠" Bergman
Sweden Simon "⁠yxngstxr⁠" Boije
Turkey Yasin "⁠xfl0ud⁠" Koç
Kazakhstan Alimzhan "⁠Alkaren⁠" Bitimbay (loan)

Denmark Tobias "⁠TOBIZ⁠" Theo (coach)

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
14:10:30 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:10:30 | INFO     | **Analysis:**
The risk level is **Moderate-High** as HEROIC's failure to qualify for the Budapest Major removes immediate market catalysts, leaving existing sticker prices vulnerable to stagnation despite the roster update. Chr1zN's acquisition is a structural fix rather than a "star power" signing, meaning it is unlikely to generate the hype volume required to spike demand for older HEROIC or Chr1zN autographs in the short term. Consequently, the recommendation is to **Hold** existing inventory to avoid selling into a low-hype trough, but strictly avoid opening new positions until the roster demonstrates competitive stability.

>>> [STEP 3] INVENTORY SCORING
14:10:53 | INFO     |     -> Scoring 100 Thieves: Score: 94, Price: 1709.00, Reason: Rain加盟的利好效应仍在持续，作为目前市场中唯一的“豪门回归+存量绝版”双重概念标的，热度在空窗期依然维持高位。
14:10:53 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 88, Price: 1499.00, Reason: 已确认为100 Thieves复兴基石，尽管今日新闻聚焦于其他战队转会，但其个人印花因绑定热门俱乐部而保持着极高的市场关注度。
14:10:53 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 65, Price: 78.60, Reason: 今日无相关新闻，市场继续消化Rain离队后的阵容变动，在缺乏新利好刺激的情况下，热度维持中性偏弱的观望状态。
14:10:53 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Spirit: Score: 30, Price: 25.00, Reason: 新闻提及从Spirit租借至HEROIC的小将Alkaren表现挣扎，侧面反映出俱乐部的人才储备或外租策略未达预期，叠加主队近期糟糕战绩，看空情绪延续。
14:10:53 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 15, Price: 0.02, Reason: 完全缺席近期的新闻版面，在转会流言和绝版炒作漫天飞舞的市场中，已被投资者彻底遗忘。
14:10:53 | INFO     |     -> Scoring ESC: Score: 95, Price: 498.00, Reason: 虽然今日无新公告，但战队被收购、品牌退出CS赛场的“绝版”逻辑依然是市场最强的炒作主线，资金惜售与抢筹心理依然稳固。
14:10:53 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:11:27 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议坚定持有。理由如下：1. 市场情绪评分极高（94/100），表明市场对该资产的看多意愿依然强烈，当前价格微跌属于良性调整。2. 新闻中关于HEROIC战队变动及无缘Major的消息，对100 Thieves这类已绝版/不活跃战队的印花不仅没有直接负面影响，反而可能因为现代战队印花的不确定性（风险增加），促使资金流向100 Thieves等'避险资产'。3. 亏损幅度微乎其微（-1.73%），此时卖出将白白损失手续费并锁定并无必要的亏损。4. 在缺乏针对该资产的利空消息且情绪高涨的情况下，耐心持有等待价值回归是最佳策略。

       Since the asset is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit, so selling now would be cutting a minor loss.
14:11:52 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 价格筑底迹象：与昨日相比，价格维持在1499.0未继续下跌，表明该价位存在支撑，短期抛压可能已释放完毕。2. 情绪依然高涨：88/100的高情绪评分显示市场并未放弃该资产，当前价格可能被视为‘超卖’，存在反弹潜力。3. 避免低位割肉：分析师报告明确建议‘持有现有库存以避免在低谷期卖出’（avoid selling into a low-hype trough）。此时卖出将锁定近19%的巨额亏损，而在没有针对rain选手的直接利空消息下，这属于非理性的恐慌操作。4. 宏观环境：虽然市场关注点在HEROIC变动，但这不影响rain作为明星选手的长期价值，继续等待反弹是更优选择。

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       **Analysis:**
       The risk level is **Moderate-High** as HEROIC's failure to qualify for the Budapest Major removes immediate market catalysts, leaving existing sticker prices vulnerable to stagnation despite the roster update. Chr1zN's acquisition is a structural fix rather than a "star power" signing, meaning it is unlikely to generate the hype volume required to spike demand for older HEROIC or Chr1zN autographs in the short term. Consequently, the recommendation is to **Hold** existing inventory to avoid selling into a low-hype trough, but strictly avoid opening new positions until the roster demonstrates competitive stability.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss of nearly 19%, taking profit is impossible, so you should consider cutting losses if you believe the price will decline further.
14:12:15 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FaZe: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 成本考量：当前仅浮亏0.13%，属于价格横盘，此时卖出不仅无法获利，还会因交易手续费产生实际亏损。2. 资产稳定性：新闻主要集中在HEROIC战队的变动和Major资格问题上，对FaZe这类头部战队印花没有直接负面影响。3. 策略一致性：分析师明确建议'持有现有库存'（Hold existing inventory）以避免在市场低迷期离场。4. 情绪尚可：65/100的情绪分属于中性偏积极，表明市场对FaZe印花仍有承接力，应耐心等待后续赛事利好或价格波动带来的盈利机会。

       Media: Chr1zN set to join HEROIC
       MIRAA
       20-11-2025 20:04
       The Danish IGL is reportedly on the brink of joining a new team after a month on the bench.
       
       
       Chr1zN is reportedly replacing LNZ as HEROIC's IGL
       OG benched IGL Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard is close to joining HEROIC to replace Linus "⁠LNZ⁠" Holtäng as the team's new skipper, according to a report from Sheep Esports.
       
       Chr1zN was moved to the bench in October alongside Nico "⁠nicoodoz⁠" Tamjidi as the team decided to shake things up after missing out on a spot at the Budapest Major. OG went on to sign Casper "⁠cadiaN⁠" Møller, who is returning to the combined role of AWP and IGL that has brought him much success in the past.
       
       LNZ has been with HEROIC since January, when the Norwegian organization signed Sangal's core. The team won the MESA Nomadic Masters Spring and advanced to Stage 2 of the Austin Major, but recent results have been mixed — a run of form that culminated in the team failing to enter the qualification zone for the Budapest Major.
       
       
       Read more
       The view from the wrong side of the Major invite cut-off
       On HEROIC, Chr1zN will reunite with Tobias "⁠TOBIZ⁠" Theo, who coached him during his nearly two-year spell on MOUZ NXT.
       
       HEROIC have yet to make a decision on Alimzhan "⁠Alkaren⁠" Bitimbay, who joined the team in August on loan from Spirit. The 18-year-old AWPer has struggled for form at the highest level, averaging a 1.03 rating while with the team.
       
       Should Chr1zN's transfer go through, HEROIC will have:

       Since the position is currently at a negligible loss of 0.13%, you cannot take profit, and the movement is likely too small to warrant cutting losses unless your outlook has changed.
14:12:35 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: SELL, Reason: 建议止盈卖出。理由如下：1. 锁定丰厚利润：持仓7天获利24.56%表现优异，符合短期交易获利了结的标准。2. 情绪预警：今日情绪评分仅为30/100（极低），这通常是高位派发的信号，意味着市场对该资产后续上涨信心不足，此时不卖更待何时。3. 规避回撤风险：虽然分析师针对HEROIC相关资产建议持有（因其处于低谷），但Spirit印花处于高位，且新闻中提及租借给HEROIC的Spirit选手Alkaren表现不佳，这并非利好。4. 策略选择：在低情绪高收益的情况下，落袋为安比继续冒险持有更符合理性的风控原则。

The EVPs and All-Stars of BLAST Rivals 2025 S2
NER0cs & Striker
21-11-2025 18:42
FURIA's team effort nets them the trophy, but the two best AWPers of 2024 take the top awards from Hong Kong.


At BLAST Rivals, FURIA won their third event in a row, their fourth trophy in five attempts, to make themselves the team to beat at the Budapest Major.

But there was no MVP for the Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo-led side, given the superlative form of Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov at the event.


The 20-year-old has the highest LAN rating of anyone in the last three months after an explosion of form at the business end of the season. He eclipsed even that level here, with a 1.42 rating and 1.16 kills per round win.

So while Falcons may have let another big game slip, the team is heading in the right direction with five consecutive top-four finishes.

m0NESY on MVP: "It hurts more than winning it at EPL because [we] had a lot of chances"
Editor's note: 'Playoff rating' at this event refers to matches from semi-finals onwards, following our usual rule to only include matches that decide placements at the top-half of an event. As it was only an eight-team event, quarter-finals to decide 5th-6th are therefore excluded.

Radar Chart stat glossary
Rating 3.0: HLTV's composite rating of kills, damage, survival, KAST, multis, and Swing

Swing Added: win probability added from positive actions

eKPR: eco-adjusted kills per round

eADR: eco-adjusted damage per round

eKPRW: eco-adjusted kills per round win

2k+: rounds with two or more kills

1k+: rounds with one or more kills

KAST: rounds with a kill, assist, survival, or death traded

RW Δ: kill differential per round win

eDmg Δ: eco-adjusted damage differential per round

eKills Δ: eco-adjusted kill differential per round

Round Swing: the win probability sum of a player's actions


Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut may not be at the ridiculous peak he hit in the first half of the year, but the Frenchman is still beyond his mortal peers.

Hong Kong gives him his fourth EVP in four events, with a great quarter-final in the thriller against Spirit (Nuke 1.41, Mirage 1.62) and putting up a fight against Falcons (1.36 series rating).

He was also by far Vitality's best in round wins (1.12 KPRW), map wins (1.47 rating), and had three player of the map showings in the arena. With FURIA's credit being so split between players, that gave him the chance for the top EVP and ZywOo took it with both hands.


Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis's extraordinary 21-kill, +29.8% Swing, 4.06-rated bonanza over 10 rounds on the T side of Nuke in the final will go down in history as one of the very best individual halves in CS history.

He capped it off with 30 frags on Mirage in the final too, leaving him as the best FURIA player of the final overall with a 1.24 rating.

The Latvian spacetaker was FURIA's best player in round wins (1.10 KPRW) and against top 10 opposition (1.18 rating). He also finished five map wins above a 1.30 rating, a clear sign of his impact beyond just that one half on Nuke.


Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato was FURIA's highest-rated player at Rivals with a 1.23 (1.35 in map wins), and led the demolition of paiN in the semi-final with a 2.10 series rating and 46 frags in 44 rounds.

While he did drop to a 1.03 rating versus top 10 teams, he still made his impact with a game-turning 1v4 on Mirage against Falcons.

That, combined with great raw figures (+3.21% Swing, 80.7 ADR, 101.3 ADRW) and such an astronomical peak in semis, was enough for an EVP.

The best players of BLAST Rivals Season 2 2025, in order:
Russia Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov

France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut

Latvia Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis

Brazil Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato

Honorable mentions
Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko finished the final in style with 64 frags across Train and Mirage, and dominated head-to-head AWP duels with m0NESY with a 12-4 K-D across the whole final.

But he only had a 1.06 rating in map wins, and 1.10 across the event as a whole. Part of that is down to how rating 3.0 rewards AWP kills less (65% of his kills came with a sniper rifle), but even in rating 2.1 molodoy was FURIA's fourth-best in map wins.

Yuri "⁠yuurih⁠" Santos had another good tournament as FURIA's stable anchor, with a high floor (+1.51% Swing, 77.2% KAST) but fell short with just 0.79 kills per round win.


molodoy and yuurih came close to EVPs
Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's 1.52-rated semi-final was enough for an honourable mention, but he was not good enough beforehand to enter EVP contention.

As the quarter-final in eight-team events is not considered a big match, Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets would essentially be a group-stage EVP had he got one. And, despite a poor start on day one, he came close with good series against a weakened The MongolZ and Vitality.

Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov put up a fight vs Falcons but was coasting against The MongolZ and had a poor decider versus Vitality.

Yi "⁠JamYoung⁠" Yang returned to form with a 1.32 rating and 90.2 ADR after a quiet few months, while Michael "⁠Grim⁠" Wince was impressive for Passion UA's quarter-final run with 1.15 KPRW.

All-Stars

FURIA's win comes with us enforcing our rule that limits teams to a maximum of three players once again, with nods going to EVPs YEKINDAR and KSCERATO for starters.

We then had to decide between yuurih for anchor or FalleN for IGL, going for yuurih given the lack of competition in his category.

FalleN, meanwhile, actually had a lower T side win-rate than Falcons skipper Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski, so that is who we have plucked for as our captain.

MVP m0NESY then beats out ZywOo and molodoy for sniping duties.

14:14:06 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:14:06 | INFO     | **Risk Level:** High, as FURIA's consecutive tournament victories have likely inflated their sticker prices to speculative peaks ahead of the StarLadder Budapest Major, creating a dangerous "buy the rumor, sell the news" environment.

**Analysis:** While m0NESY's MVP performance validates his stickers as high-demand blue-chip assets, the market saturation regarding FURIA's "team to beat" narrative suggests limited upside potential for FalleN, YEKINDAR, and KSCERATO items in the short term.

**Recommendation:** **Sell** FURIA assets immediately to capitalize on the pre-Major hype bubble, but **Hold** m0NESY inventory as a hedge against market volatility.

14:15:05 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 情绪支撑强劲：今日情绪评分高达90/100，显示市场对该资产信心十足，当前的微幅回调（-1.73%）更像是上涨中继而非下跌趋势。2. 资金轮动逻辑：新闻重点在于FURIA夺冠和活跃选手的表现，分析师建议卖出过热的FURIA印花。通常情况下，从短期热点（活跃战队）撤出的获利资金，往往会流向100 Thieves这类低波动、高稀缺性的老款印花进行避险或沉淀。3. 避免无效操作：当前价格基本持平，卖出不仅无法止盈，反而会因手续费造成实际亏损。在缺乏针对该资产的直接利空消息时，持有是保持仓位价值的最佳策略。

       The EVPs and All-Stars of BLAST Rivals 2025 S2

       FURIA's team effort nets them the trophy, but the two best AWPers of 2024 take the top awards from Hong Kong.
       
       
       At BLAST Rivals, FURIA won their third event in a row, their fourth trophy in five attempts, to make themselves the team to beat at the Budapest Major.
       
       But there was no MVP for the Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo-led side, given the superlative form of Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov at the event.
       
       
       The 20-year-old has the highest LAN rating of anyone in the last three months after an explosion of form at the business end of the season. He eclipsed even that level here, with a 1.42 rating and 1.16 kills per round win.
       
       So while Falcons may have let another big game slip, the team is heading in the right direction with five consecutive top-four finishes.

       Editor's note: 'Playoff rating' at this event refers to matches from semi-finals onwards, following our usual rule to only include matches that decide placements at the top-half of an event. As it was only an eight-team event, quarter-finals to decide 5th-6th are therefore excluded.

       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut may not be at the ridiculous peak he hit in the first half of the year, but the Frenchman is still beyond his mortal peers.
       
       Hong Kong gives him his fourth EVP in four events, with a great quarter-final in the thriller against Spirit (Nuke 1.41, Mirage 1.62) and putting up a fight against Falcons (1.36 series rating).
       
       He was also by far Vitality's best in round wins (1.12 KPRW), map wins (1.47 rating), and had three player of the map showings in the arena. With FURIA's credit being so split between players, that gave him the chance for the top EVP and ZywOo took it with both hands.
       
       
       Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis's extraordinary 21-kill, +29.8% Swing, 4.06-rated bonanza over 10 rounds on the T side of Nuke in the final will go down in history as one of the very best individual halves in CS history.
       
       He capped it off with 30 frags on Mirage in the final too, leaving him as the best FURIA player of the final overall with a 1.24 rating.
       
       The Latvian spacetaker was FURIA's best player in round wins (1.10 KPRW) and against top 10 opposition (1.18 rating). He also finished five map wins above a 1.30 rating, a clear sign of his impact beyond just that one half on Nuke.
       
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato was FURIA's highest-rated player at Rivals with a 1.23 (1.35 in map wins), and led the demolition of paiN in the semi-final with a 2.10 series rating and 46 frags in 44 rounds.
       
       While he did drop to a 1.03 rating versus top 10 teams, he still made his impact with a game-turning 1v4 on Mirage against Falcons.
       
       That, combined with great raw figures (+3.21% Swing, 80.7 ADR, 101.3 ADRW) and such an astronomical peak in semis, was enough for an EVP.
       
       The best players of BLAST Rivals Season 2 2025, in order:
       Russia Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut
       
       Latvia Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis
       
       Brazil Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato
       
       Honorable mentions
       Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko finished the final in style with 64 frags across Train and Mirage, and dominated head-to-head AWP duels with m0NESY with a 12-4 K-D across the whole final.
       
       But he only had a 1.06 rating in map wins, and 1.10 across the event as a whole. Part of that is down to how rating 3.0 rewards AWP kills less (65% of his kills came with a sniper rifle), but even in rating 2.1 molodoy was FURIA's fourth-best in map wins.
       
       Yuri "⁠yuurih⁠" Santos had another good tournament as FURIA's stable anchor, with a high floor (+1.51% Swing, 77.2% KAST) but fell short with just 0.79 kills per round win.
       
       
       molodoy and yuurih came close to EVPs
       Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's 1.52-rated semi-final was enough for an honourable mention, but he was not good enough beforehand to enter EVP contention.
       
       As the quarter-final in eight-team events is not considered a big match, Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets would essentially be a group-stage EVP had he got one. And, despite a poor start on day one, he came close with good series against a weakened The MongolZ and Vitality.
       
       Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov put up a fight vs Falcons but was coasting against The MongolZ and had a poor decider versus Vitality.
       
       Yi "⁠JamYoung⁠" Yang returned to form with a 1.32 rating and 90.2 ADR after a quiet few months, while Michael "⁠Grim⁠" Wince was impressive for Passion UA's quarter-final run with 1.15 KPRW.
       
       All-Stars
       
       FURIA's win comes with us enforcing our rule that limits teams to a maximum of three players once again, with nods going to EVPs YEKINDAR and KSCERATO for starters.
       
       We then had to decide between yuurih for anchor or FalleN for IGL, going for yuurih given the lack of competition in his category.
       
       FalleN, meanwhile, actually had a lower T side win-rate than Falcons skipper Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski, so that is who we have plucked for as our captain.
       
       MVP m0NESY then beats out ZywOo and molodoy for sniping duties.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       **Risk Level:** High, as FURIA's consecutive tournament victories have likely inflated their sticker prices to speculative peaks ahead of the StarLadder Budapest Major, creating a dangerous "buy the rumor, sell the news" environment.
       
       **Analysis:** While m0NESY's MVP performance validates his stickers as high-demand blue-chip assets, the market saturation regarding FURIA's "team to beat" narrative suggests limited upside potential for FalleN, YEKINDAR, and KSCERATO items in the short term.
       
       **Recommendation:** **Sell** FURIA assets immediately to capitalize on the pre-Major hype bubble, but **Hold** m0NESY inventory as a hedge against market volatility.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at a loss, taking profit is impossible, and a 1.73% decline is likely too minor to justify cutting the loss.
14:15:41 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 技术面支撑坚实：价格连续多日稳定在1499.0，表明该价位存在强力支撑，下跌动能已衰竭，此时卖出极大概率是'倒在黎明前'。2. 情绪面背离：尽管处于深幅浮亏（-18.97%），但今日情绪评分高达85/100，这种'价跌量稳情绪高'的背离形态通常是反弹的前兆。3. 资金轮动预期：分析师报告建议卖出近期过热的FURIA资产，这部分获利资金往往会回流到处于低位的经典老将（如rain/FaZe）印花上寻找安全边际。4. 避免恐慌操作：当前新闻全是对其他战队的报道，并无针对rain的实质利空，盲目割肉不符合价值投资逻辑。

       He capped it off with 30 frags on Mirage in the final too, leaving him as the best FURIA player of the final overall with a 1.24 rating.
       
       The Latvian spacetaker was FURIA's best player in round wins (1.10 KPRW) and against top 10 opposition (1.18 rating). He also finished five map wins above a 1.30 rating, a clear sign of his impact beyond just that one half on Nuke.
       
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato was FURIA's highest-rated player at Rivals with a 1.23 (1.35 in map wins), and led the demolition of paiN in the semi-final with a 2.10 series rating and 46 frags in 44 rounds.
       
       While he did drop to a 1.03 rating versus top 10 teams, he still made his impact with a game-turning 1v4 on Mirage against Falcons.
       
       That, combined with great raw figures (+3.21% Swing, 80.7 ADR, 101.3 ADRW) and such an astronomical peak in semis, was enough for an EVP.
       
       The best players of BLAST Rivals Season 2 2025, in order:
       Russia Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut
       
       Latvia Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis
       
       Brazil Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato
       
       Honorable mentions
       Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko finished the final in style with 64 frags across Train and Mirage, and dominated head-to-head AWP duels with m0NESY with a 12-4 K-D across the whole final.
       
       But he only had a 1.06 rating in map wins, and 1.10 across the event as a whole. Part of that is down to how rating 3.0 rewards AWP kills less (65% of his kills came with a sniper rifle), but even in rating 2.1 molodoy was FURIA's fourth-best in map wins.
       
       Yuri "⁠yuurih⁠" Santos had another good tournament as FURIA's stable anchor, with a high floor (+1.51% Swing, 77.2% KAST) but fell short with just 0.79 kills per round win.
       
       
       molodoy and yuurih came close to EVPs
       Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's 1.52-rated semi-final was enough for an honourable mention, but he was not good enough beforehand to enter EVP contention.
       
       As the quarter-final in eight-team events is not considered a big match, Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets would essentially be a group-stage EVP had he got one. And, despite a poor start on day one, he came close with good series against a weakened The MongolZ and Vitality.
       
       Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov put up a fight vs Falcons but was coasting against The MongolZ and had a poor decider versus Vitality.
       
       Yi "⁠JamYoung⁠" Yang returned to form with a 1.32 rating and 90.2 ADR after a quiet few months, while Michael "⁠Grim⁠" Wince was impressive for Passion UA's quarter-final run with 1.15 KPRW.
       
       All-Stars
       
       FURIA's win comes with us enforcing our rule that limits teams to a maximum of three players once again, with nods going to EVPs YEKINDAR and KSCERATO for starters.
       
       We then had to decide between yuurih for anchor or FalleN for IGL, going for yuurih given the lack of competition in his category.
       
       FalleN, meanwhile, actually had a lower T side win-rate than Falcons skipper Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski, so that is who we have plucked for as our captain.
       
       MVP m0NESY then beats out ZywOo and molodoy for sniping duties.

       **Risk Level:** High, as FURIA's consecutive tournament victories have likely inflated their sticker prices to speculative peaks ahead of the StarLadder Budapest Major, creating a dangerous "buy the rumor, sell the news" environment.
       
       **Analysis:** While m0NESY's MVP performance validates his stickers as high-demand blue-chip assets, the market saturation regarding FURIA's "team to beat" narrative suggests limited upside potential for FalleN, YEKINDAR, and KSCERATO items in the short term.
       
       **Recommendation:** **Sell** FURIA assets immediately to capitalize on the pre-Major hype bubble, but **Hold** m0NESY inventory as a hedge against market volatility.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the position is currently at a negligible loss of 0.25%, you cannot take profit and the decline is likely too minimal to warrant cutting losses.
14:16:44 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 价格地板效应：当前价格0.02已处于市场绝对底部（Market Floor），下行空间已被封死，此时卖出扣除交易手续费后将面临实际亏损或零收益，操作毫无意义。2. 盈亏比极佳：由于价格无法继续下跌，持仓风险极低，而任何微小的反弹都能带来成倍的收益，属于典型的'彩票型'资产。3. 遵循策略指引：价格分析明确指出‘目前处于盈亏平衡的市场底部，应持有以等待潜在上涨’。4. 逆向思维：15/100的极低情绪分说明无人问津，但这正是底部特征，在没有资金成本压力的情况下，长期持有等待未来赛事催化是唯一理性的选择。

       FURIA's team effort nets them the trophy, but the two best AWPers of 2024 take the top awards from Hong Kong.
       
       
       At BLAST Rivals, FURIA won their third event in a row, their fourth trophy in five attempts, to make themselves the team to beat at the Budapest Major.
       
       But there was no MVP for the Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo-led side, given the superlative form of Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov at the event.
       
       
       The 20-year-old has the highest LAN rating of anyone in the last three months after an explosion of form at the business end of the season. He eclipsed even that level here, with a 1.42 rating and 1.16 kills per round win.
       
       So while Falcons may have let another big game slip, the team is heading in the right direction with five consecutive top-four finishes.

       Editor's note: 'Playoff rating' at this event refers to matches from semi-finals onwards, following our usual rule to only include matches that decide placements at the top-half of an event. As it was only an eight-team event, quarter-finals to decide 5th-6th are therefore excluded.

       Hong Kong gives him his fourth EVP in four events, with a great quarter-final in the thriller against Spirit (Nuke 1.41, Mirage 1.62) and putting up a fight against Falcons (1.36 series rating).
       
       He was also by far Vitality's best in round wins (1.12 KPRW), map wins (1.47 rating), and had three player of the map showings in the arena. With FURIA's credit being so split between players, that gave him the chance for the top EVP and ZywOo took it with both hands.

nitr0 to miss Budapest Major
MIRAA
22-11-2025 02:58
NRG's captain will not be able to play at the event due to personal reasons.


nitr0 will be replaced by daps in Budapest
Nick "⁠nitr0⁠" Cannella will miss the StarLadder Budapest Major to attend the birth of his child, the North American organization announced on Friday. He will be replaced by head coach Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele, who has been submitted as the team's substitute for the event.

nitr0's absence is a blow for NRG, who are hoping to improve on the Austin Major's top-27 finish. The North American team will travel to Budapest on the back of a title-winning run at Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey — their second consecutive Fragadelphia trophy.

daps returned to a coaching role in March 2024 after four months on NRG's starting roster. This year, he has only played one map with the team, putting in a 0.55 rating in a 16-14 victory against BLUEJAYS in ESL Challenger League Season 50 North America Cup 1.

Wildcard bench roster
Sumljiv
22-11-2025 06:02
Wildcard appear unlikely to keep any members of their current roster.


Wildcard have transfer listed Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, and Love "⁠phzy⁠" Smidebrant, benched Jaxon "⁠Peeping⁠" Cornwell, and announced they are set to part ways with Maciej "⁠F1KU⁠" Miklas following the Pole's contract expiry at the end of November.

The move continues a roller-coaster period for the organization, as the team moved phzy and stanislaw away from their active roster during the summer only to reinstate them shortly after, while also removing Sebastian "⁠fr3nd⁠" Kuśmierz and Tim "⁠susp⁠" Ångström since the break.

Wildcard's core leaves behind a legacy of two Major appearances in Shanghai and Austin, but the partnership has turned sour in recent months. In an interview with Dust2.us, phzy made the shocking revelation that he heard ChatGPT was involved in the roster decisions and stated that he felt "betrayed" by the organization following his benching.

The upheaval leaves Wildcard with no players on the active roster, but the organization did announce that more news on their CS division is set to come "in the coming days."

Wildcard are now:

Canada Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz (transfer-listed)
Sweden Love "⁠phzy⁠" Smidebrant (transfer-listed)
United States Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt (transfer-listed)
United States Jaxon "⁠Peeping⁠" Cornwell (benched)

Four new EVPs given out from before Rating 3.0's release
NER0cs
22-11-2025 22:48
We have revised the EVP lists of all the events from this year before eco-adjusted data was available.


With just one event remaining before the top 20 players of 2025 list kicks off, it's a good time to conduct some housekeeping from before rating 3.0's release.

EVP lists were made at the time using rating 2.1, and without access to fully reliable eco-adjusted data, so it makes sense to go back and revise the lists to ensure players are judged on a level playing field ahead of the end of the year.

For some players, that's good news, and for others their 'score' for the event has gone down compared to 2.1. But in this article, we will only discuss the players who have gone from an honourable mention, or valuable player, into an exceptionally valuable player (EVP). So let's begin.

BLAST Bounty Season 1

Valeriy "⁠b1t⁠" Vakhovskiy is our first player with an extra EVP, taking his tally to three for the year after nods at super-elite IEM events in Katowice and Cologne.

His Bounty Season 1 stats, all the way back in January, were already strong but we decided against an EVP given that he was behind Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan on rating 2.1 and kills per round win in the LAN portion.

Now, however, he has jumped ahead of iM on LAN (to 1.16). Under 3.0, even if you take out his dismantling of Imperial Valkyries, he is at an EVP-level 1.21 rating, +1.49% Swing, and 119.7 ADR in round wins.


João "⁠snow⁠" Vinicius is the other benefactor of rating 3.0 from the first event of the year, making a huge jump from 1.18 on LAN to 1.39 on the new rating system.

In that Natus Vincere quarter-final, snow was at a server-high +5.50% Swing, with a 1.39 rating and solid eco-adjusted damage and kills.

That turns a good quarter-final into a great one, enough to confirm an EVP after good online form against GamerLegion and FaZe beforehand.

BLAST.tv Austin Major

Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi's 1.08 rating 2.1 made it hard for him to confirm his EVP in Austin originally, having plenty of lows to go with peaks against Liquid, Aurora, and Spirit.

But on rating 3.0, those peaks have got even better and MOUZ's lurker averages a 1.38 rating in their 8 notable map wins, and 1.27 including the full three maps of the semi-final.

He was also the teams' leader in round wins, and a 1.12 rating rather than 1.08 completes his case for making it into the EVP list.

IEM Cologne 2025

We were harsh on Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool at Cologne originally, finding flaws in his group stage (where he had just 0.77 kills per round win) and not counting his 1.12-rated semi-final as enough for an EVP.

But on 3.0, he jumps way up to 1.34 against MOUZ, a strong enough playoffs to push him into the EVP list even if the group stage was a team effort between all of Vitality.

Another EVP puts ropz on seven for the year, smashing his record of 5 from 2019 with one event to go.

>>> [STEP 3] INVENTORY SCORING
14:17:38 | INFO     |     -> Scoring 100 Thieves: Score: 88, Price: 1709.00, Reason: Rain加盟的利好效应仍在，作为“豪门回归+绝版存量”概念，在市场缺乏新热点时依然具备较强的吸引力。
14:17:38 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 82, Price: 1499.00, Reason: 转会100 Thieves带来的话题红利仍在，虽今日无个人新闻，但其印花作为新王朝基石的象征意义支撑着较高的市场热度。
14:17:38 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 60, Price: 78.50, Reason: Rain离队后，阵容处于重组后的真空期，缺乏新战报刺激，市场热度随大盘冷却而缓慢下行。
14:17:38 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 12, Price: 0.02, Reason: 完全缺席近期的新闻版面，在转会流言和绝版炒作漫天飞舞的市场中，已被投资者彻底遗忘。

14:17:38 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Vitality: Score: 85, Price: 22.88, Reason: HLTV通过Rating 3.0修正了EVP名单，ropz在IEM科隆的表现被上调为EVP，年度EVP数量达到7个创个人纪录。这一数据挖掘进一步佐证了ropz作为顶级选手的含金量，利好其个人及所属战队印花。

>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:18:00 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 资产相关性低：新闻主要聚焦于NRG战队队长缺席Major和Wildcard战队解散，这对100 Thieves（已绝版/不活跃）印花没有直接的负面影响，甚至可能因为活跃战队的不确定性增加，促使资金流向100 Thieves这种'避险资产'。2. 情绪面稳定：今日情绪评分高达88/100，显示市场整体买气依然旺盛，未受个别战队利空消息的显著拖累。3. 价格波动微小：当前浮亏仅1.73%，属于正常的市场噪音，此时卖出既无必要也无利可图。4. 策略定力：尽管分析师建议卖出NRG资产，但对非相关资产（如100 Thieves）应保持'持有'策略，等待Major期间整体市场的流动性溢出效应。

       nitr0 to miss Budapest Major
       MIRAA
       22-11-2025 02:58
       NRG's captain will not be able to play at the event due to personal reasons.
       
       
       nitr0 will be replaced by daps in Budapest
       Nick "⁠nitr0⁠" Cannella will miss the StarLadder Budapest Major to attend the birth of his child, the North American organization announced on Friday. He will be replaced by head coach Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele, who has been submitted as the team's substitute for the event.
       
       nitr0's absence is a blow for NRG, who are hoping to improve on the Austin Major's top-27 finish. The North American team will travel to Budapest on the back of a title-winning run at Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey — their second consecutive Fragadelphia trophy.

       Wildcard appear unlikely to keep any members of their current roster.
       
       
       Wildcard have transfer listed Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, and Love "⁠phzy⁠" Smidebrant, benched Jaxon "⁠Peeping⁠" Cornwell, and announced they are set to part ways with Maciej "⁠F1KU⁠" Miklas following the Pole's contract expiry at the end of November.
       
       The move continues a roller-coaster period for the organization, as the team moved phzy and stanislaw away from their active roster during the summer only to reinstate them shortly after, while also removing Sebastian "⁠fr3nd⁠" Kuśmierz and Tim "⁠susp⁠" Ångström since the break.
       
       Wildcard's core leaves behind a legacy of two Major appearances in Shanghai and Austin, but the partnership has turned sour in recent months. In an interview with Dust2.us, phzy made the shocking revelation that he heard ChatGPT was involved in the roster decisions and stated that he felt "betrayed" by the organization following his benching.
       
       The upheaval leaves Wildcard with no players on the active roster, but the organization did announce that more news on their CS division is set to come "in the coming days."

       Four new EVPs given out from before Rating 3.0's release
       NER0cs
       22-11-2025 22:48
       We have revised the EVP lists of all the events from this year before eco-adjusted data was available.
       
       
       With just one event remaining before the top 20 players of 2025 list kicks off, it's a good time to conduct some housekeeping from before rating 3.0's release.
       
       EVP lists were made at the time using rating 2.1, and without access to fully reliable eco-adjusted data, so it makes sense to go back and revise the lists to ensure players are judged on a level playing field ahead of the end of the year.
       
       For some players, that's good news, and for others their 'score' for the event has gone down compared to 2.1. But in this article, we will only discuss the players who have gone from an honourable mention, or valuable player, into an exceptionally valuable player (EVP). So let's begin.
       
       BLAST Bounty Season 1
       
       Valeriy "⁠b1t⁠" Vakhovskiy is our first player with an extra EVP, taking his tally to three for the year after nods at super-elite IEM events in Katowice and Cologne.
       
       His Bounty Season 1 stats, all the way back in January, were already strong but we decided against an EVP given that he was behind Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan on rating 2.1 and kills per round win in the LAN portion.
       
       Now, however, he has jumped ahead of iM on LAN (to 1.16). Under 3.0, even if you take out his dismantling of Imperial Valkyries, he is at an EVP-level 1.21 rating, +1.49% Swing, and 119.7 ADR in round wins.
       
       
       João "⁠snow⁠" Vinicius is the other benefactor of rating 3.0 from the first event of the year, making a huge jump from 1.18 on LAN to 1.39 on the new rating system.
       
       In that Natus Vincere quarter-final, snow was at a server-high +5.50% Swing, with a 1.39 rating and solid eco-adjusted damage and kills.
       
       That turns a good quarter-final into a great one, enough to confirm an EVP after good online form against GamerLegion and FaZe beforehand.
       
       BLAST.tv Austin Major
       
       Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi's 1.08 rating 2.1 made it hard for him to confirm his EVP in Austin originally, having plenty of lows to go with peaks against Liquid, Aurora, and Spirit.
       
       But on rating 3.0, those peaks have got even better and MOUZ's lurker averages a 1.38 rating in their 8 notable map wins, and 1.27 including the full three maps of the semi-final.
       
       He was also the teams' leader in round wins, and a 1.12 rating rather than 1.08 completes his case for making it into the EVP list.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       Based on the imminent StarLadder Budapest Major and the roster instability reported, the market risk is currently **High**.

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently trading at a loss, you cannot take profit, and cutting a loss of only 1.73% may be premature unless your investment thesis has changed.
14:18:29 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 消息面隔离：今日的利空消息集中在NRG（队长缺席）和Wildcard（阵容解散）两支战队，这对作为顶级强队FaZe核心成员的rain没有直接负面影响。相反，中小战队的动荡可能促使资金流向FaZe等'确定性高'的资产。2. 情绪面支撑：情绪评分虽微降但仍高达82/100，显示市场对该资产的内在价值依然认可，当前价格处于被错杀的超卖区间。3. 拒绝恐慌止损：虽然目前浮亏约19%，但在1499.0价位已连续多日企稳，说明抛压已消化。此时盲目听从通用价格分析进行'割肉'，将失去未来Major赛事期间可能出现的反弹机会。

       nitr0 to miss Budapest Major
       MIRAA
       22-11-2025 02:58
       NRG's captain will not be able to play at the event due to personal reasons.
       
       
       nitr0 will be replaced by daps in Budapest
       Nick "⁠nitr0⁠" Cannella will miss the StarLadder Budapest Major to attend the birth of his child, the North American organization announced on Friday. He will be replaced by head coach Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele, who has been submitted as the team's substitute for the event.
       
       nitr0's absence is a blow for NRG, who are hoping to improve on the Austin Major's top-27 finish. The North American team will travel to Budapest on the back of a title-winning run at Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey — their second consecutive Fragadelphia trophy.

       22-11-2025 06:02
       Wildcard appear unlikely to keep any members of their current roster.
       
       
       Wildcard have transfer listed Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, and Love "⁠phzy⁠" Smidebrant, benched Jaxon "⁠Peeping⁠" Cornwell, and announced they are set to part ways with Maciej "⁠F1KU⁠" Miklas following the Pole's contract expiry at the end of November.
       
       The move continues a roller-coaster period for the organization, as the team moved phzy and stanislaw away from their active roster during the summer only to reinstate them shortly after, while also removing Sebastian "⁠fr3nd⁠" Kuśmierz and Tim "⁠susp⁠" Ångström since the break.
       
       Wildcard's core leaves behind a legacy of two Major appearances in Shanghai and Austin, but the partnership has turned sour in recent months. In an interview with Dust2.us, phzy made the shocking revelation that he heard ChatGPT was involved in the roster decisions and stated that he felt "betrayed" by the organization following his benching.
       
       The upheaval leaves Wildcard with no players on the active roster, but the organization did announce that more news on their CS division is set to come "in the coming days."
       
       Wildcard are now:
       
       Canada Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz (transfer-listed)

       Four new EVPs given out from before Rating 3.0's release
       NER0cs
       22-11-2025 22:48
       We have revised the EVP lists of all the events from this year before eco-adjusted data was available.
       
       
       With just one event remaining before the top 20 players of 2025 list kicks off, it's a good time to conduct some housekeeping from before rating 3.0's release.
       
       EVP lists were made at the time using rating 2.1, and without access to fully reliable eco-adjusted data, so it makes sense to go back and revise the lists to ensure players are judged on a level playing field ahead of the end of the year.
       
       For some players, that's good news, and for others their 'score' for the event has gone down compared to 2.1. But in this article, we will only discuss the players who have gone from an honourable mention, or valuable player, into an exceptionally valuable player (EVP). So let's begin.
       
       BLAST Bounty Season 1
       
       Valeriy "⁠b1t⁠" Vakhovskiy is our first player with an extra EVP, taking his tally to three for the year after nods at super-elite IEM events in Katowice and Cologne.
       
       His Bounty Season 1 stats, all the way back in January, were already strong but we decided against an EVP given that he was behind Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan on rating 2.1 and kills per round win in the LAN portion.
       
       Now, however, he has jumped ahead of iM on LAN (to 1.16). Under 3.0, even if you take out his dismantling of Imperial Valkyries, he is at an EVP-level 1.21 rating, +1.49% Swing, and 119.7 ADR in round wins.
       
       
       João "⁠snow⁠" Vinicius is the other benefactor of rating 3.0 from the first event of the year, making a huge jump from 1.18 on LAN to 1.39 on the new rating system.
       
       In that Natus Vincere quarter-final, snow was at a server-high +5.50% Swing, with a 1.39 rating and solid eco-adjusted damage and kills.
       
       That turns a good quarter-final into a great one, enough to confirm an EVP after good online form against GamerLegion and FaZe beforehand.
       
       BLAST.tv Austin Major
       
       Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi's 1.08 rating 2.1 made it hard for him to confirm his EVP in Austin originally, having plenty of lows to go with peaks against Liquid, Aurora, and Spirit.
       
       But on rating 3.0, those peaks have got even better and MOUZ's lurker averages a 1.38 rating in their 8 notable map wins, and 1.27 including the full three maps of the semi-final.
       
       He was also the teams' leader in round wins, and a 1.12 rating rather than 1.08 completes his case for making it into the EVP list.
       
       IEM Cologne 2025
       
       We were harsh on Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool at Cologne originally, finding flaws in his group stage (where he had just 0.77 kills per round win) and not counting his 1.12-rated semi-final as enough for an EVP.
       
       But on 3.0, he jumps way up to 1.34 against MOUZ, a strong enough playoffs to push him into the EVP list even if the group stage was a team effort between all of Vitality.
       
       Another EVP puts ropz on seven for the year, smashing his record of 5 from 2019 with one event to go.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       Based on the imminent StarLadder Budapest Major and the roster instability reported, the market risk is currently **High**. NRG's competitive viability has plummeted with the substitution of captain nitr0 for a statistically weak coach, signaling a high probability of an early exit and subsequent devaluation of their tournament stickers. **Sell** NRG assets immediately to preempt the price drop associated with poor performance, and avoid entering positions on Wildcard items until the organization's chaotic restructuring stabilizes.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the position is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit, and selling now would mean realizing a negligible 0.25% loss.
14:19:31 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 绝对底部与成本摩擦：当前价格0.02已触及市场地板价（Price Floor），此时卖出扣除交易手续费后将导致实际亏损，操作不具备经济效益。2. 风险收益不对称：该资产下行空间已被封死，而随着11月24日布达佩斯Major开赛，作为常客的The MongolZ若有比赛爆冷表现，价格极易跳涨至0.03（即50%收益），属于极佳的'彩票型'期权。3. 消息面隔离：分析师提示的'高风险'主要针对阵容崩塌的NRG和Wildcard，The MongolZ未受波及。4. 逆向操作：12/100的极低情绪分说明市场处于被遗忘的冷淡期，适合埋伏等待赛事热度带动。

>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:20:25 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续坚定持有。理由如下：1. 核心受益资产：分析师报告明确指出，资金正在轮动进入'稀缺的老款锦标赛印花'（Scarce, older tournament stickers）以对冲新箱子传闻带来的风险，100 Thieves作为典型的绝版老款印花，正处于这波资金避险的中心。2. 情绪极佳：90/100的高情绪评分验证了上述逻辑，市场对该类资产的买入意愿强烈。3. 忽略噪音：当前-1.73%的浮亏仅为正常的市场波动，考虑到交易量正在增加（Increased volume），价格有望在避险情绪推动下修复。4. 策略执行：此时卖出不仅违背了'持有优质老款资产'的分析建议，还会白白损失手续费。
14:20:25 | INFO     |        [Context]
CS2 Market Update (2025-11-23): Market sentiment is mixed. Some older tournament stickers are seeing increased volume. Rumors of a new case release are circulating.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently presents a **medium risk** profile due to the volatility introduced by conflicting legacy volume spikes and the looming liquidity drain of a rumored case release. Capital is rotating into scarce, older tournament stickers as a hedge, while the broader market faces potential sell-pressure from investors liquidating assets to prepare for new content. **Recommendation: Hold** premium vintage assets to capture current momentum, but delay new entries on modern stickers until the case drops and prices stabilize.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the position is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit, and the minor 1.73% decline is likely too small to justify cutting losses.
14:20:54 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 资金避险逻辑：分析师报告明确指出，面对新箱子传闻，资金正在轮动进入'老款锦标赛印花'（Older tournament stickers）寻求避险。rain作为知名老将的高价印花，属于此类受益的'优质资产'。2. 情绪背离：尽管浮亏近19%，但80/100的高情绪分显示市场信心依然坚挺，暗示当前价格处于超卖区域，存在反弹需求。3. 拒绝恐慌止损：通用价格分析建议割肉是基于止损规则，但忽略了当前特殊的宏观环境（资金流向老款资产）。此时卖出极大概率是'倒在黎明前'，不如利用高情绪等待估值修复。

       Since you are currently at a loss of nearly 19%, taking profit is impossible, so you should consider cutting your loss to preserve your remaining capital.
14:21:22 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FaZe: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 成本考量：当前价格基本持平（-0.25%），属于横盘整理，此时卖出不仅无法获利，扣除交易手续费后反而会造成约10%-15%的实际亏损。2. 市场环境：分析师指出虽然有'新箱子传闻'带来的流动性压力，但建议持有优质资产。FaZe作为头部战队印花，具有较好的抗跌性和流动性。3. 情绪中性：58/100的情绪评分显示市场处于观望状态，并未出现恐慌性抛售，价格支撑良好。4. 策略选择：在未触及止损线且无实质利空的情况下，保持仓位观察新箱子落地后的市场反应是更稳健的策略。

       You should hold the asset, as there is no profit to realize and selling at breakeven would result in a net loss after transaction fees.
14:22:29 | INFO     |     -> Decision for ESC: SELL, Reason: 建议止盈卖出。理由如下：1. 获利极丰：持仓仅7天即获得40.08%的巨额收益，属于短期爆发式上涨。在金融交易中，面对如此快速的利润，落袋为安是铁律。2. 情绪过热预警：今日情绪评分高达95/100，表明市场处于极度贪婪和FOMO（错失恐惧）状态，这往往是短期顶部的信号，此时是'在人声鼎沸时离场'（Sell into strength）的最佳时机。3. 现金为王：尽管分析师提到老款饰品有避险属性，但'新箱子发布传闻'带来的全市场流动性吸血效应不容忽视。将账面浮盈转化为现金，既锁定了胜局，又保留了在未来市场波动中重新布局的主动权。4. 价格分析建议：明确指出应锁定利润，避免因贪婪导致利润回吐。

gla1ve announces retirement; moves into coaching
MIRAA
24-11-2025 17:00
Astralis' iconic IGL hangs up his mouse and keyboard, moving on to a new phase in his life.


Former Astralis captain Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander has announced that he is retiring from playing and moving into coaching.

The 30-year-old had been out of action since July, when he was moved to ENCE's bench after 18 months with the team. During his time with the Finnish organization, he notably led the squad to victory at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024 — the final LAN trophy of his career.

gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
But what gla1ve will mostly be remembered by — and what will make him a strong Hall of Fame candidate in the future — will be his achievements with Astralis. Signed in October 2016 to replace Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen, gla1ve guided the team to their first Major trophy a few months into his stint against Virtus.pro in Atlanta.

He then played a key role as Astralis built an era of dominance in 2018 and 2019, winning 16 titles, including three more Majors, and the first edition of the Intel Grand Slam.


gla1ve won four Majors during his career, all with Astralis
"What a ride it has been," he wrote in a post on X. "So many memories, so many victories, and lessons I’ll carry with me forever.

"I still get goosebumps thinking about the Majors, the Intel Grand Slam, and everything we built during the golden Astralis era. To be part of creating something that special doesn’t happen often. A huge thank you to my incredible teammates and coaches from back then—you made it some of the best years of my life."

Widely praised for his leadership ability and tactical acumen, gla1ve was also a skilled player in his own right, making HLTV's Top 20 Player of the Year ranking in 2018 at No.8. He was named the MVP of IEM Beijing 2019, where he posted a tournament-high 1.48 rating, and was among the EVPs on 12 occasions.

His time on Astralis' roster came to an end in July 2023, when he was replaced by Victor "⁠Staehr⁠" Staehr and Benjamin "⁠blameF⁠" Bremer took over as captain. Four months later, he signed with ENCE, where he immediately had to deal with a storm as three players were on their way out of the team.

With the former 9INE core in tow, gla1ve guided ENCE to the playoffs at IEM Katowice 2024 and through the Europe RMR leading to the Copenhagen Major. But as results deteriorated, ENCE moved away from the Polish core, signing Viktor "⁠sdy⁠" Orudzhev and promoting Paavo "⁠podi⁠" Heiskanen from the academy squad.

And the team ended 2024 on a high note: with only five days of practice after the arrivals of Ryan "⁠Neityu⁠" Aubry and Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara, they beat 9z, The MongolZ, and HEROIC en route to the title in Espoo.


gla1ve with ENCE at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024
gla1ve's final LAN appearance was at the Tipsport Conquest of Prague 2025 Finals, where ENCE finished second to fnatic. Weeks later, the Finnish organization would sign Rigon "⁠rigoN⁠" Gashi to the team and hand the captaincy duties over to sdy.

gla1ve becomes the third member of Astralis' iconic team to retire from playing, after Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth and Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen. Like the 'Clutch Minister,' he will try his hand at coaching — which he views as a natural progression for his career after his time on the server.

"I have always known that I would become a coach once my career as a player ended," he told HLTV.

"I have learned so many useful things throughout my career as an IGL, both in-game and also outside the game, and now I am just looking forward to being able to use all that as a coach.

"I am still here to lead a team to victory. That part hasn't changed."

14:23:06 | INFO     | The market presents **moderate risk** due to typical pre-Major liquidity rotation before Budapest, though this is offset by high-opportunity volatility surrounding legacy player news. gla1ve's retirement announcement serves as a massive financial catalyst, permanently capping the supply of his autographs and historically guaranteeing a short-term value spike for his "Golden Era" Astralis stickers. **Buy** gla1ve autographs immediately (specifically 2017-2019 era) to capture the retirement ROI, while avoiding NRG positions due to the instability of nitr0 missing the Major.

14:23:35 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 消息面提振：新闻核心是传奇选手gla1ve退役，分析师明确指出这将成为'巨大的金融催化剂'（Massive financial catalyst），并建议买入/持有相关老款印花。虽然gla1ve是Astralis成员，但这种'传奇退役'事件通常会引发整个老款绝版印花板块（包括100 Thieves）的情绪共振和价值重估。2. 情绪极度乐观：今日情绪评分高达93/100，市场对老款资产的追捧热度极高。3. 价格企稳：价格维持在1699-1709区间震荡，浮亏仅2.30%，属于良性调整。4. 策略逻辑：在全市场关注'老款绝版资产'的当下，持有同属性的100 Thieves印花，等待板块轮动带来的溢价效应是最佳选择。

       "After talking with daps, they actually asked multiple people, but there was still a good chance nitr0 could play," neL said on X about NRG's decision to have Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele step in to play. "Most didn't want to IGL and play nitr0's spots."
       
       "The team decided daps playing was the best solution, as he knows the team/system and can IGL. Understandable."

       gla1ve announces retirement; moves into coaching
       MIRAA
       24-11-2025 17:00
       Astralis' iconic IGL hangs up his mouse and keyboard, moving on to a new phase in his life.
       
       
       Former Astralis captain Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander has announced that he is retiring from playing and moving into coaching.
       
       The 30-year-old had been out of action since July, when he was moved to ENCE's bench after 18 months with the team. During his time with the Finnish organization, he notably led the squad to victory at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024 — the final LAN trophy of his career.

       gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
       But what gla1ve will mostly be remembered by — and what will make him a strong Hall of Fame candidate in the future — will be his achievements with Astralis. Signed in October 2016 to replace Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen, gla1ve guided the team to their first Major trophy a few months into his stint against Virtus.pro in Atlanta.
       
       He then played a key role as Astralis built an era of dominance in 2018 and 2019, winning 16 titles, including three more Majors, and the first edition of the Intel Grand Slam.
       
       
       gla1ve won four Majors during his career, all with Astralis
       "What a ride it has been," he wrote in a post on X. "So many memories, so many victories, and lessons I’ll carry with me forever.
       
       "I still get goosebumps thinking about the Majors, the Intel Grand Slam, and everything we built during the golden Astralis era. To be part of creating something that special doesn’t happen often. A huge thank you to my incredible teammates and coaches from back then—you made it some of the best years of my life."
       
       Widely praised for his leadership ability and tactical acumen, gla1ve was also a skilled player in his own right, making HLTV's Top 20 Player of the Year ranking in 2018 at No.8. He was named the MVP of IEM Beijing 2019, where he posted a tournament-high 1.48 rating, and was among the EVPs on 12 occasions.
       
       His time on Astralis' roster came to an end in July 2023, when he was replaced by Victor "⁠Staehr⁠" Staehr and Benjamin "⁠blameF⁠" Bremer took over as captain. Four months later, he signed with ENCE, where he immediately had to deal with a storm as three players were on their way out of the team.
       
       With the former 9INE core in tow, gla1ve guided ENCE to the playoffs at IEM Katowice 2024 and through the Europe RMR leading to the Copenhagen Major. But as results deteriorated, ENCE moved away from the Polish core, signing Viktor "⁠sdy⁠" Orudzhev and promoting Paavo "⁠podi⁠" Heiskanen from the academy squad.
       
       And the team ended 2024 on a high note: with only five days of practice after the arrivals of Ryan "⁠Neityu⁠" Aubry and Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara, they beat 9z, The MongolZ, and HEROIC en route to the title in Espoo.
       
       
       gla1ve with ENCE at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024
       gla1ve's final LAN appearance was at the Tipsport Conquest of Prague 2025 Finals, where ENCE finished second to fnatic. Weeks later, the Finnish organization would sign Rigon "⁠rigoN⁠" Gashi to the team and hand the captaincy duties over to sdy.
       
       gla1ve becomes the third member of Astralis' iconic team to retire from playing, after Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth and Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen. Like the 'Clutch Minister,' he will try his hand at coaching — which he views as a natural progression for his career after his time on the server.

       dupreeh interview: Analyst work, tier-one meta, and "living" life
       "I have always known that I would become a coach once my career as a player ended," he told HLTV.
       
       "I have learned so many useful things throughout my career as an IGL, both in-game and also outside the game, and now I am just looking forward to being able to use all that as a coach.
       
       "I am still here to lead a team to victory. That part hasn't changed."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market presents **moderate risk** due to typical pre-Major liquidity rotation before Budapest, though this is offset by high-opportunity volatility surrounding legacy player news. gla1ve's retirement announcement serves as a massive financial catalyst, permanently capping the supply of his autographs and historically guaranteeing a short-term value spike for his "Golden Era" Astralis stickers. **Buy** gla1ve autographs immediately (specifically 2017-2019 era) to capture the retirement ROI, while avoiding NRG positions due to the instability of nitr0 missing the Major.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       You cannot take profit since the position is currently at a loss, so you should consider cutting the loss only if you anticipate further price decline.
14:23:56 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 价格筑底特征明显：rain印花价格已连续多日稳定在1499.0，显示该位置有极强的买盘支撑，下跌动能衰竭，此时卖出属于'地板割肉'。2. 板块联动效应：新闻头条为传奇选手gla1ve退役，这引发了市场对'老将/传奇选手'印花的怀旧潮和价值重估（Legacy player news catalyst）。rain作为现役的顶级老将，极易受到这波怀旧资金的溢出效应利好。3. 情绪高涨：85/100的情绪分表明市场处于亢奋状态，配合即将到来的Major赛事，作为常青树的rain随时可能迎来估值修复。4. 策略执行：在深度浮亏（-19%）且无个股利空的情况下，利用全市场的怀旧情绪等待反弹是挽回损失的最佳途径。

       Astralis' iconic IGL hangs up his mouse and keyboard, moving on to a new phase in his life.
       
       
       Former Astralis captain Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander has announced that he is retiring from playing and moving into coaching.
       
       The 30-year-old had been out of action since July, when he was moved to ENCE's bench after 18 months with the team. During his time with the Finnish organization, he notably led the squad to victory at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024 — the final LAN trophy of his career.

       gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
       But what gla1ve will mostly be remembered by — and what will make him a strong Hall of Fame candidate in the future — will be his achievements with Astralis. Signed in October 2016 to replace Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen, gla1ve guided the team to their first Major trophy a few months into his stint against Virtus.pro in Atlanta.
       
       He then played a key role as Astralis built an era of dominance in 2018 and 2019, winning 16 titles, including three more Majors, and the first edition of the Intel Grand Slam.
       
       
       gla1ve won four Majors during his career, all with Astralis
       "What a ride it has been," he wrote in a post on X. "So many memories, so many victories, and lessons I’ll carry with me forever.
       
       "I still get goosebumps thinking about the Majors, the Intel Grand Slam, and everything we built during the golden Astralis era. To be part of creating something that special doesn’t happen often. A huge thank you to my incredible teammates and coaches from back then—you made it some of the best years of my life."
       
       Widely praised for his leadership ability and tactical acumen, gla1ve was also a skilled player in his own right, making HLTV's Top 20 Player of the Year ranking in 2018 at No.8. He was named the MVP of IEM Beijing 2019, where he posted a tournament-high 1.48 rating, and was among the EVPs on 12 occasions.
       
       His time on Astralis' roster came to an end in July 2023, when he was replaced by Victor "⁠Staehr⁠" Staehr and Benjamin "⁠blameF⁠" Bremer took over as captain. Four months later, he signed with ENCE, where he immediately had to deal with a storm as three players were on their way out of the team.
       
       With the former 9INE core in tow, gla1ve guided ENCE to the playoffs at IEM Katowice 2024 and through the Europe RMR leading to the Copenhagen Major. But as results deteriorated, ENCE moved away from the Polish core, signing Viktor "⁠sdy⁠" Orudzhev and promoting Paavo "⁠podi⁠" Heiskanen from the academy squad.
       
       And the team ended 2024 on a high note: with only five days of practice after the arrivals of Ryan "⁠Neityu⁠" Aubry and Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara, they beat 9z, The MongolZ, and HEROIC en route to the title in Espoo.

       gla1ve's final LAN appearance was at the Tipsport Conquest of Prague 2025 Finals, where ENCE finished second to fnatic. Weeks later, the Finnish organization would sign Rigon "⁠rigoN⁠" Gashi to the team and hand the captaincy duties over to sdy.
       
       gla1ve becomes the third member of Astralis' iconic team to retire from playing, after Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth and Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen. Like the 'Clutch Minister,' he will try his hand at coaching — which he views as a natural progression for his career after his time on the server.

       dupreeh interview: Analyst work, tier-one meta, and "living" life
       "I have always known that I would become a coach once my career as a player ended," he told HLTV.
       
       "I have learned so many useful things throughout my career as an IGL, both in-game and also outside the game, and now I am just looking forward to being able to use all that as a coach.
       
       "I am still here to lead a team to victory. That part hasn't changed."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market presents **moderate risk** due to typical pre-Major liquidity rotation before Budapest, though this is offset by high-opportunity volatility surrounding legacy player news. gla1ve's retirement announcement serves as a massive financial catalyst, permanently capping the supply of his autographs and historically guaranteeing a short-term value spike for his "Golden Era" Astralis stickers. **Buy** gla1ve autographs immediately (specifically 2017-2019 era) to capture the retirement ROI, while avoiding NRG positions due to the instability of nitr0 missing the Major.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the position is currently at a loss of nearly 19%, it is impossible to take profit, so selling now would be cutting your losses.
14:24:26 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FaZe: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 成本摩擦：当前价格基本持平（-0.25%），此时卖出扣除交易手续费后将产生实际亏损，且没有任何避险的必要性。2. 市场催化剂：新闻头条gla1ve退役虽然直接利好Astralis相关印花，但也激活了整个饰品市场的收藏属性和交易热度，FaZe作为顶级战队印花有望受益于整体市场活跃度的提升。3. 风险隔离：分析师提示的风险点主要集中在阵容不整的NRG和Wildcard，FaZe基本面稳固，不受此负面影响。4. 赛事预期：布达佩斯Major即将开赛，FaZe作为夺冠热门之一，其印花在赛事期间通常具有较好的流动性和关注度，建议持仓观望。

       Astralis' iconic IGL hangs up his mouse and keyboard, moving on to a new phase in his life.

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the position is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit, and the 0.25% decline is likely too insignificant to warrant cutting losses.
14:24:49 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 价格铁底：当前价格0.02已处于Steam市场的绝对地板价，下行风险为零。此时卖出扣除手续费后将面临实际亏损，属于无效操作。2. 赛事期权属性：布达佩斯Major即将开赛，The MongolZ作为经常上演'以弱胜强'好戏的亚洲劲旅，其印花具有极强的'彩票'属性。一旦在Major中打出亮眼表现，价格极易翻倍（至0.03或0.04）。3. 策略逻辑：在零风险的前提下，持有该资产相当于免费保留了一张Major赛事的兑奖券，耐心等待赛事热度带动情绪回暖是唯一的理性选择。

       Short: neL sheds light on NRG decision
       "After talking with daps, they actually asked multiple people, but there was still a good chance nitr0 could play," neL said on X about NRG's decision to have Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele step in to play. "Most didn't want to IGL and play nitr0's spots."
       
       "The team decided daps playing was the best solution, as he knows the team/system and can IGL. Understandable."

       gla1ve announces retirement; moves into coaching
       MIRAA
       24-11-2025 17:00
       Astralis' iconic IGL hangs up his mouse and keyboard, moving on to a new phase in his life.
       
       
       Former Astralis captain Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander has announced that he is retiring from playing and moving into coaching.
       
       The 30-year-old had been out of action since July, when he was moved to ENCE's bench after 18 months with the team. During his time with the Finnish organization, he notably led the squad to victory at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024 — the final LAN trophy of his career.

       gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
       But what gla1ve will mostly be remembered by — and what will make him a strong Hall of Fame candidate in the future — will be his achievements with Astralis. Signed in October 2016 to replace Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen, gla1ve guided the team to their first Major trophy a few months into his stint against Virtus.pro in Atlanta.
       
       He then played a key role as Astralis built an era of dominance in 2018 and 2019, winning 16 titles, including three more Majors, and the first edition of the Intel Grand Slam.
       
       
       gla1ve won four Majors during his career, all with Astralis
       "What a ride it has been," he wrote in a post on X. "So many memories, so many victories, and lessons I’ll carry with me forever.
       
       "I still get goosebumps thinking about the Majors, the Intel Grand Slam, and everything we built during the golden Astralis era. To be part of creating something that special doesn’t happen often. A huge thank you to my incredible teammates and coaches from back then—you made it some of the best years of my life."
       
       Widely praised for his leadership ability and tactical acumen, gla1ve was also a skilled player in his own right, making HLTV's Top 20 Player of the Year ranking in 2018 at No.8. He was named the MVP of IEM Beijing 2019, where he posted a tournament-high 1.48 rating, and was among the EVPs on 12 occasions.
       
       His time on Astralis' roster came to an end in July 2023, when he was replaced by Victor "⁠Staehr⁠" Staehr and Benjamin "⁠blameF⁠" Bremer took over as captain. Four months later, he signed with ENCE, where he immediately had to deal with a storm as three players were on their way out of the team.
       
       With the former 9INE core in tow, gla1ve guided ENCE to the playoffs at IEM Katowice 2024 and through the Europe RMR leading to the Copenhagen Major. But as results deteriorated, ENCE moved away from the Polish core, signing Viktor "⁠sdy⁠" Orudzhev and promoting Paavo "⁠podi⁠" Heiskanen from the academy squad.
       
       And the team ended 2024 on a high note: with only five days of practice after the arrivals of Ryan "⁠Neityu⁠" Aubry and Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara, they beat 9z, The MongolZ, and HEROIC en route to the title in Espoo.
       
       
       gla1ve with ENCE at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024
       gla1ve's final LAN appearance was at the Tipsport Conquest of Prague 2025 Finals, where ENCE finished second to fnatic. Weeks later, the Finnish organization would sign Rigon "⁠rigoN⁠" Gashi to the team and hand the captaincy duties over to sdy.
       
       gla1ve becomes the third member of Astralis' iconic team to retire from playing, after Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth and Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen. Like the 'Clutch Minister,' he will try his hand at coaching — which he views as a natural progression for his career after his time on the server.

       "I have always known that I would become a coach once my career as a player ended," he told HLTV.
       
       "I have learned so many useful things throughout my career as an IGL, both in-game and also outside the game, and now I am just looking forward to being able to use all that as a coach.
       
       "I am still here to lead a team to victory. That part hasn't changed."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market presents **moderate risk** due to typical pre-Major liquidity rotation before Budapest, though this is offset by high-opportunity volatility surrounding legacy player news. gla1ve's retirement announcement serves as a massive financial catalyst, permanently capping the supply of his autographs and historically guaranteeing a short-term value spike for his "Golden Era" Astralis stickers. **Buy** gla1ve autographs immediately (specifically 2017-2019 era) to capture the retirement ROI, while avoiding NRG positions due to the instability of nitr0 missing the Major.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are at break-even, you should hold for potential upside rather than selling now and likely losing money on transaction fees.

# News for 20251125

- Spirit战队公布首发阵容，donk状态火热，相关印花价格开始异动。
- Mouz战队使用了大量"绿龙"印花，市场关注度上升。
- 传闻本次Major冠军印花将采用全新设计，引发市场对旧版印花的抛售担忧。
- 社区讨论热度集中在 "Spirit Holo" 和 "Mouz Gold" 上。

【每日CS】赛事方被指历史最差之一？布达佩斯Major首日，都有哪些事？

它在首日便被指历史最差之一，布达佩斯Major第一天都有哪些事？
比赛因现场技术原因延误2小时，精彩操作回放画面错乱浑浊，现场解说被闭麦静音被迫上演哑剧。
没错，这些都是布达佩斯Major主办方在比赛第一日出现的低级失误。
除此以外，即便是线上观赛的国内观众同样未能逃过一劫。
“这个服务器……你们有没有戴耳机看直播的，这声音怎么有问题啊？我还是把这个右耳机摘了吧。”

除了直播内容以外，昨日的比赛现场同样出现混乱，一群手持Imperial（绿盔）战队贴纸的人在现场集结，抗议V社10天前将该队贴纸Logo从新版改回旧版的操作。
不过个人认为V社这波制裁Imperial新队标的操作完全没有毛病。
毕竟根据此前的消息，V社之所以回溯Imperial Logo是因为该队新Logo与他们的赞助商的标识高度相似。

此外，再来看一下作业（Pick'em）。在首日结束两轮BO1较量，尤其是在3-0预测大热的FaZe败给教练替补出战的G2之后，相信大部分人的作业都已受到重创。
目前主播的作业全胜与全败中已经炸了3个。
那么各位的作业现在还好吗？

另外，两支在本届Major第一阶段率先出战的中国战队在昨日都收获了两战全败的战绩，如此表现在此就不做过多评述了。
各位加油吧。

Major开赛的同时，还有另一件大事值得关注。
丹麦传奇指挥gla1ve宣布结束选手生涯，转型为教练。
如此一来，7年前的王朝A队仅剩下魔男（Magisk）和阿汤哥（device）两人仍在现役，而他们将在本届Major的第二赛段亮相。
最后，Major第二日赛程将于今晚10点打响。

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
14:25:45 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:25:45 | INFO     | 1. **Risk Level:** High, primarily driven by market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) regarding the rumored overhaul of Champion sticker designs and the volatility surrounding the Imperial logo reversion.

2. **Recommendation:** **Hold** core positions while executing short-term speculative **Buys** on "Spirit Holo" and "Mouz Gold" assets.

3. **Financial Analysis:** Despite the panic selling risks associated with the new design rumors, the visible demand spikes for Spirit and Mouz items—fueled by donk's performance and high community engagement—present a profitable scalping opportunity amidst the broader market instability caused by the Major's technical failures.

>>> [STEP 3] INVENTORY SCORING
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring 100 Thieves: Score: 85, Price: 1699.00, Reason: Rain加盟的利好已被部分消化，但在Major首日混乱和作业炸裂的背景下，作为非参赛（或未提及参赛）的“场外优质资产”，其绝版印花反而因避险属性维持高热度。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 80, Price: 1499.00, Reason: FaZe的翻车侧面印证了Rain离队对老东家的打击，反而提升了他在玩家心中的地位（“没有Rain不行”），其个人印花热度稳中有升。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 40, Price: 78.50, Reason: Major首日爆冷输给由教练替补出战的G2，且被指“重创了大部分人的3-0预测作业”，这一灾难性表现直接打击了市场信心，看空情绪急剧升温。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 10, Price: 0.02, Reason: 新闻未提及具体战队名，但提到“两支中国战队两战全败”，虽The MongolZ是蒙古队，但作为亚洲代表队，整体赛区表现低迷会连累其市场信心，且无独立利好支撑。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring HEROIC: Score: 50, Price: 0.83, Reason: Chr1zN的转会传闻仍未落地，且无Major首日相关表现报道，市场关注度被Spirit和Mouz的异动抢走，处于被冷落状态。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring MOUZ: Score: 85, Price: 1.01, Reason: 新闻特指“Mouz Gold”成为社区讨论热点，且战队使用了大量绿龙印花引发关注。这种直接的市场异动信号通常意味着短期炒作资金的大量涌入。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Spirit: Score: 88, Price: 24.90, Reason: 新闻明确指出“Spirit Holo”成为社区讨论焦点，且donk状态火热引发印花价格异动。尽管Major主办方拉胯，但Spirit作为热门标的，其印花正处于资金炒作的风口。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FURIA: Score: 90, Price: 178.00, Reason: 作为Major前的四连冠霸主，虽然首日战况未详细提及，但在FaZe翻车的情况下，FURIA的稳健形象更加凸显，依然是资金避险和争冠押注的首选。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Vitality: Score: 75, Price: 22.67, Reason: 作为顶级强队，在Major首日的混乱中未受直接波及（可能未出战或表现正常），但市场对“旧版印花抛售担忧”的情绪可能会压制其高价印花的上涨空间，维持高位震荡。
14:25:57 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Sashi: Score: 60, Price: 98.60, Reason: 刚刚夺得Omen Retake冠军的小利好仍在，但在Major开赛的宏大背景下，这种次级赛事的荣誉很快被淹没，热度回落。
14:25:57 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:26:28 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 策略一致性：分析师报告明确建议'持有核心仓位'（Hold core positions），100 Thieves作为绝版老款印花，属于此类防御性核心资产，受Major新印花传闻的冲击较小。2. 情绪面支撑：尽管市场整体面临'高风险'评级和FUD（恐惧、不确定、怀疑）情绪，但这主要针对现役战队和新印花设计。该资产情绪评分仍维持在85/100的高位，显示买盘信心未散。3. 价格韧性：在Major首日混乱和各种流言冲击下，价格仅微跌2.30%，表现出极强的抗跌性。4. 避免恐慌：此时卖出不仅没有任何避险意义（因为它是绝版品），反而会锁定不必要的亏损和手续费。

       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is impossible, and a minor 2.30% drop is generally too small to justify cutting losses unless your long-term outlook has changed.
14:26:44 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 消息面影响有限：虽然新闻提到FaZe爆冷败给G2导致部分玩家作业（Pick'em）受损，但这属于短期赛事波动，且分析师建议'持有核心仓位'（Hold core positions），rain作为FaZe核心老将，其印花价值不应因一场比赛失利而彻底否定。2. 价格底部确认：价格连续多日维持在1499.0，显示该位置有极强的支撑，市场并未因FaZe首败而进一步恐慌杀跌。3. 情绪尚可：80/100的情绪分表明市场并未绝望，反而在期待后续比赛的反弹。4. 拒绝低位割肉：在深幅浮亏（-19%）且无实质性利空（如退役、长期伤病）的情况下，卖出将锁定最大亏损，不如利用Major赛事期间的高关注度等待修复机会。

       1. **Risk Level:** High, primarily driven by market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) regarding the rumored overhaul of Champion sticker designs and the volatility surrounding the Imperial logo reversion.
       
       2. **Recommendation:** **Hold** core positions while executing short-term speculative **Buys** on "Spirit Holo" and "Mouz Gold" assets.
       
       3. **Financial Analysis:** Despite the panic selling risks associated with the new design rumors, the visible demand spikes for Spirit and Mouz items—fueled by donk's performance and high community engagement—present a profitable scalping opportunity amidst the broader market instability caused by the Major's technical failures.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at an 18.97% loss, taking profit is impossible, so you should consider cutting your loss to preserve remaining capital.
14:27:18 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FaZe: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 反应过度风险：虽然新闻指出FaZe首战爆冷输给残阵G2导致情绪评分骤降至40/100，但这仅是Major瑞士轮的第一场BO1比赛，强队慢热是常态，并未伤及晋级根本。2. 价格韧性：尽管利空消息明确，但价格仅微跌0.25%，说明市场主力并未恐慌抛售，当前价格仍有强支撑。3. 策略定力：分析师建议'持有核心仓位'（Hold core positions），FaZe作为顶级强队属于此类资产。此时因一场失利而卖出，不仅无法获利，还会因频繁交易损失手续费，应耐心等待后续比赛状态回暖。

# News for 20251126

【每日CS】tN1R暗示Spirit加练Inferno？TheMongolZ正式回应Senzu下放原因。CNCS已有两支队伍在MAJOR出局。

绿龙猎鹰会否扩充图池？Major也有两支中国队伍出局。今日CS有何新鲜事？终于破译成功？绿龙队员tN1R昨日的一则小镇（Inferno）配图动态被不少人解读为绿龙为Major秘密加练。这张现阵容从来不打的地图，更有人开玩笑称这可能是专门用来对付猎鹰的奇招。毕竟绿龙尚未赢下过尼孩(NiKo和小孩: m0NESY)加盟后的猎鹰，而小镇则是猎鹰的弱图之一。而被Q到的猎鹰其实也早已在图池上有所行动，除了在刚结束的近期比赛中连续在小镇上击败蜜蜂（Vitality）与黑豹（FURIA），他们还曾在官推暗示考虑启用从来不打的游乐园（Overpass）加深图池。在即将到来的布达佩斯Major第三赛段，我们或许会见证绿龙选出小镇、猎鹰启用游乐园等一系列非常规博弈。当然需要说明的是，目前这些都还停留在推测阶段，不论是tN1R的动态还是猎鹰的官推暗示，都不排除可能只是Major战前迷惑对手的烟雾弹。


另一方面，蒙古（TheMongolZ）于昨日发布了IEM成都纪录片，视频中最引人关注的便是俱乐部正式回应了此前外界对于临时下放Senzu的疑问。“远离喧嚣，让内心平静。”与此前外媒的报道一样，Senzu暂别赛场的原因只是需要一些时间来休养生息，而根据此前爆料，他可能会在布达佩斯Major之后回归赛场。

最后关注到赛场，布达佩斯Major已经结束了第二日较量，在第一阶段率先出战的两支中国队伍都以全败战绩出局离场。如果说RA接连败给Complexity以及Legacy还能因对手实力尚可在舆论中有一丝回旋余地，那么LVG除了败给FaZe情有可原，在之后惨败给Imperial被横扫则无疑令人失望透顶。“泰国队输完输越南再输缅甸，现在没人输了，你倒告诉我怎么解释。”目前将在第二赛段亮相的Tyloo已成为CNCS在布达佩斯Major的最后独苗。

此外，第一阶段的另一支热门队伍FaZe同样表现低迷。本被认为至少能以3-1晋级的他们，却在前日不敌NAVI后，又在昨晚不敌VP，落入了1-2组别濒临淘汰。而今晚他们将与Fnatic在生死关头背水一战。



FaZe staring at elimination in Budapest after loss to NIP
MIRAA
26-11-2025 00:07
karrigan's troops are on the brink of an early exit at the Major after another disappointing showing.


FaZe have dropped down to the 1-2 pool in Stage 1 of the Budapest Major after a 13-8 defeat to Ninjas in Pyjamas on Overpass, a result that leaves Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's charges on the brink of elimination just two days into the tournament.

The victory is a huge boost for Ninjas in Pyjamas, who had made "a lot of stupid mistakes" on this map on Monday against NRG, according to Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara. They have since looked more composed and resolute — a promising sign as they enter the best-of-three stages.

xKacpersky: "If one guy makes a mistake in a tactic, it can affect other players. Here we didn't make these shit mistakes"
Worse than the loss itself for FaZe was how badly they played. They began both halves with 3-0 runs, but it took individual heroics from karrigan and Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken for them to even post gun rounds.

FaZe looked incredibly disjointed on the CT side and made a lot of unforced errors as Ninjas in Pyjamas took control of the game after a 0-3 start, with a 3K from karrigan the only gun round they won in the first half.


FaZe kept themselves in the game after clutching a 2v3 situation, but there would be no miraculous comeback. xKacpersky secured his team's first round of the half with a 1v2 clutch that swung the momentum back in the Ninjas' favor, with a quad-kill from Twistzz merely delaying the inevitable.

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
14:28:04 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:28:04 | INFO     | **Analysis:**

1.  **Risk Level:** **High**, as the confirmed elimination of two Chinese teams (RA, LVG) removes significant regional demand, while "blue-chip" asset FaZe Clan is trading at a distressed level with a high probability of an early exit.
2.  **Financial Assessment:** Market sentiment is turning bearish for major favorites; FaZe's poor form (1-2 record) threatens a panic sell-off of their usually high-value stickers, while the value of RA and LVG items will likely crash following their exit.
3.  **Recommendation:** **Sell** FaZe and RA/LVG holdings immediately to mitigate loss exposure; **Hold** Tyloo assets only if high-risk tolerance permits, as they remain the sole speculative vehicle for the Chinese market.

>>> [STEP 3] INVENTORY SCORING
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring 100 Thieves: Score: 85, Price: 1699.00, Reason: 在Major正赛打得火热且冷门频出的情况下，作为场外最确定的“豪门回归+绝版”概念，依然是资金在混乱局势中的优质避风港。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring rain: Score: 82, Price: 1499.00, Reason: FaZe的濒临淘汰进一步强化了“Rain离队后FaZe崩盘”的叙事，侧面提升了Rain的个人历史地位和印花纪念价值。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FaZe: Score: 25, Price: 78.50, Reason: Major开局极其崩盘，接连输给G2（教练替补）、NAVI、VP和NIP，目前1-2濒临淘汰，且战报形容其表现“极度脱节”、“令人失望透顶”，市场恐慌情绪蔓延，抛售压力巨大。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring The MongolZ: Score: 35, Price: 0.02, Reason: 俱乐部发布纪录片回应Senzu下放原因，并透露其可能在Major后回归。这一澄清有助于稳定粉丝情绪，但在当前Major惨败（新闻暗示亚洲队伍表现不佳）的背景下，反弹力度有限。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring HEROIC: Score: 48, Price: 0.86, Reason: Chr1zN转会传闻未有新进展，且新闻提到gla1ve带领ENCE曾在Espoo击败HEROIC夺冠（旧闻），在Major激战正酣时缺乏存在感。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring MOUZ: Score: 80, Price: 0.99, Reason: 虽然今日无直接新闻，但昨日关于“Mouz Gold”和“绿龙印花混搭”的市场异动余波未平，且Spinx补获EVP的利好仍在，热度维持较高水平。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Spirit: Score: 92, Price: 25.30, Reason: 队员tN1R暗示加练Inferno，被解读为针对苦主Falcons的秘密武器，这种“复仇+战术升级”的叙事极具吸引力；叠加此前Holo印花的热度，市场期待值拉满。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring FURIA: Score: 88, Price: 175.50, Reason: 虽然新闻提到Falcons曾击败FURIA，但作为近期四连冠霸主，其在Major前的统治力依然是市场信心的基石，短期内受FaZe翻车影响，避险资金可能进一步涌入。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Vitality: Score: 75, Price: 22.67, Reason: 新闻提到Falcons在近期比赛中击败过Vitality，且Falcons正在扩充图池备战。这对Vitality来说是竞争压力增大的信号，但作为顶级强队的基本面未变，热度维持高位震荡。
14:28:15 | INFO     |     -> Scoring Sashi: Score: 55, Price: 98.60, Reason: 夺冠热度已随Major开赛迅速冷却，且无后续新闻支撑，关注度回归平淡。
14:28:15 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
14:28:34 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 资产属性隔离：新闻主要报道的是FaZe战队濒临淘汰和中国战队出局，这对'100 Thieves'（已绝版老款印花）没有任何直接的负面影响。相反，随着活跃战队（如FaZe）表现不佳，资金可能进一步流向确定性更高的老款绝版资产进行避险。2. 情绪面稳定：尽管市场因FaZe失利出现恐慌，但100 Thieves的情绪评分仍维持在85/100的高位，显示该特定资产的持有者信心未受波及。3. 价格韧性：当前价格1699.0与昨日持平，浮亏仅2.30%，表现出极强的抗跌性。4. 策略执行：分析师建议卖出的是FaZe和已淘汰的中国战队印花，对于非相关的老款优质资产，应继续持有等待市场情绪修复后的溢价。

       此外，第一阶段的另一支热门队伍FaZe同样表现低迷。本被认为至少能以3-1晋级的他们，却在前日不敌NAVI后，又在昨晚不敌VP，落入了1-2组别濒临淘汰。而今晚他们将与Fnatic在生死关头背水一战。
       
       
       
       FaZe staring at elimination in Budapest after loss to NIP
       MIRAA

       karrigan's troops are on the brink of an early exit at the Major after another disappointing showing.
       
       
       FaZe have dropped down to the 1-2 pool in Stage 1 of the Budapest Major after a 13-8 defeat to Ninjas in Pyjamas on Overpass, a result that leaves Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's charges on the brink of elimination just two days into the tournament.
       
       The victory is a huge boost for Ninjas in Pyjamas, who had made "a lot of stupid mistakes" on this map on Monday against NRG, according to Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara. They have since looked more composed and resolute — a promising sign as they enter the best-of-three stages.

       Worse than the loss itself for FaZe was how badly they played. They began both halves with 3-0 runs, but it took individual heroics from karrigan and Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken for them to even post gun rounds.
       
       FaZe looked incredibly disjointed on the CT side and made a lot of unforced errors as Ninjas in Pyjamas took control of the game after a 0-3 start, with a 3K from karrigan the only gun round they won in the first half.
       
       
       FaZe kept themselves in the game after clutching a 2v3 situation, but there would be no miraculous comeback. xKacpersky secured his team's first round of the half with a 1v2 clutch that swung the momentum back in the Ninjas' favor, with a quad-kill from Twistzz merely delaying the inevitable.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       **Analysis:**
       
       1.  **Risk Level:** **High**, as the confirmed elimination of two Chinese teams (RA, LVG) removes significant regional demand, while "blue-chip" asset FaZe Clan is trading at a distressed level with a high probability of an early exit.
       2.  **Financial Assessment:** Market sentiment is turning bearish for major favorites; FaZe's poor form (1-2 record) threatens a panic sell-off of their usually high-value stickers, while the value of RA and LVG items will likely crash following their exit.
       3.  **Recommendation:** **Sell** FaZe and RA/LVG holdings immediately to mitigate loss exposure; **Hold** Tyloo assets only if high-risk tolerance permits, as they remain the sole speculative vehicle for the Chinese market.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is impossible, and you should only cut the loss if you believe the asset's value will continue to decline.
14:29:28 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: SELL, Reason: 建议止损卖出。理由如下：1. 明确的分析师卖出信号：分析师报告针对FaZe战队目前的糟糕表现（1-2战绩，濒临淘汰）发出了明确的‘Sell’指令，警告若不及时离场可能面临‘恐慌性抛售’（Panic sell-off）。2. 基本面恶化：新闻详细描述了FaZe战队状态‘极其脱节’（incredibly disjointed），且今晚将进行生死战。Rain作为FaZe的核心成员，其印花价值与战队晋级情况高度绑定，一旦出局，价格将面临进一步暴跌。3. 风险控制：尽管今日情绪评分（82/100）尚可，可能源于粉丝对FaZe逆风翻盘的期待，但在金融交易中，‘不要与趋势作对’。当前战队基本面严重受损，继续持有是在赌博而非投资。4. 止损原则：当前浮亏约19%，虽然痛苦，但相比战队出局后可能出现的腰斩式下跌，此时离场是保留剩余本金的理性选择。

       【每日CS】tN1R暗示Spirit加练Inferno？TheMongolZ正式回应Senzu下放原因。CNCS已有两支队伍在MAJOR出局。
       
       绿龙猎鹰会否扩充图池？Major也有两支中国队伍出局。今日CS有何新鲜事？终于破译成功？绿龙队员tN1R昨日的一则小镇（Inferno）配图动态被不少人解读为绿龙为Major秘密加练。这张现阵容从来不打的地图，更有人开玩笑称这可能是专门用来对付猎鹰的奇招。毕竟绿龙尚未赢下过尼孩(NiKo和小孩: m0NESY)加盟后的猎鹰，而小镇则是猎鹰的弱图之一。而被Q到的猎鹰其实也早已在图池上有所行动，除了在刚结束的近期比赛中连续在小镇上击败蜜蜂（Vitality）与黑豹（FURIA），他们还曾在官推暗示考虑启用从来不打的游乐园（Overpass）加深图池。在即将到来的布达佩斯Major第三赛段，我们或许会见证绿龙选出小镇、猎鹰启用游乐园等一系列非常规博弈。当然需要说明的是，目前这些都还停留在推测阶段，不论是tN1R的动态还是猎鹰的官推暗示，都不排除可能只是Major战前迷惑对手的烟雾弹。
       
       
       另一方面，蒙古（TheMongolZ）于昨日发布了IEM成都纪录片，视频中最引人关注的便是俱乐部正式回应了此前外界对于临时下放Senzu的疑问。“远离喧嚣，让内心平静。”与此前外媒的报道一样，Senzu暂别赛场的原因只是需要一些时间来休养生息，而根据此前爆料，他可能会在布达佩斯Major之后回归赛场。
       
       最后关注到赛场，布达佩斯Major已经结束了第二日较量，在第一阶段率先出战的两支中国队伍都以全败战绩出局离场。如果说RA接连败给Complexity以及Legacy还能因对手实力尚可在舆论中有一丝回旋余地，那么LVG除了败给FaZe情有可原，在之后惨败给Imperial被横扫则无疑令人失望透顶。“泰国队输完输越南再输缅甸，现在没人输了，你倒告诉我怎么解释。”目前将在第二赛段亮相的Tyloo已成为CNCS在布达佩斯Major的最后独苗。
       
       此外，第一阶段的另一支热门队伍FaZe同样表现低迷。本被认为至少能以3-1晋级的他们，却在前日不敌NAVI后，又在昨晚不敌VP，落入了1-2组别濒临淘汰。而今晚他们将与Fnatic在生死关头背水一战。
       
       
       
       FaZe staring at elimination in Budapest after loss to NIP
       MIRAA
       26-11-2025 00:07
       karrigan's troops are on the brink of an early exit at the Major after another disappointing showing.
       
       
       FaZe have dropped down to the 1-2 pool in Stage 1 of the Budapest Major after a 13-8 defeat to Ninjas in Pyjamas on Overpass, a result that leaves Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's charges on the brink of elimination just two days into the tournament.
       
       The victory is a huge boost for Ninjas in Pyjamas, who had made "a lot of stupid mistakes" on this map on Monday against NRG, according to Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara. They have since looked more composed and resolute — a promising sign as they enter the best-of-three stages.

       Worse than the loss itself for FaZe was how badly they played. They began both halves with 3-0 runs, but it took individual heroics from karrigan and Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken for them to even post gun rounds.
       
       FaZe looked incredibly disjointed on the CT side and made a lot of unforced errors as Ninjas in Pyjamas took control of the game after a 0-3 start, with a 3K from karrigan the only gun round they won in the first half.
       
       
       FaZe kept themselves in the game after clutching a 2v3 situation, but there would be no miraculous comeback. xKacpersky secured his team's first round of the half with a 1v2 clutch that swung the momentum back in the Ninjas' favor, with a quad-kill from Twistzz merely delaying the inevitable.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       **Analysis:**
       
       1.  **Risk Level:** **High**, as the confirmed elimination of two Chinese teams (RA, LVG) removes significant regional demand, while "blue-chip" asset FaZe Clan is trading at a distressed level with a high probability of an early exit.
       2.  **Financial Assessment:** Market sentiment is turning bearish for major favorites; FaZe's poor form (1-2 record) threatens a panic sell-off of their usually high-value stickers, while the value of RA and LVG items will likely crash following their exit.
       3.  **Recommendation:** **Sell** FaZe and RA/LVG holdings immediately to mitigate loss exposure; **Hold** Tyloo assets only if high-risk tolerance permits, as they remain the sole speculative vehicle for the Chinese market.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       No, you should hold because there is no profit to take and selling at break-even usually results in a net loss after transaction fees.

载物欲为Major削发明志，能否完成地狱归来？“我该不该为Major再剃一次光头？”昨日晚间，载物在社媒晒出了自己两年前的光头造型，并向社区提出了这个疑问。而知名主持人Banks则现身评论区，力挺立刻行动。需要说明的是，之所以载物会有剃光头的想法，是因为2023年他曾在巴黎Major前削发明志，并最终以MVP之姿帮助队伍拿下了那届Major冠军。自那之后，社区便有了“光头能给Major加Buff”的小玄学。话说回来，怪不得猎鹰在前日的俱乐部视频中给NiKo整了个光头特效。

此外顺带一提，根据apEX昨日的动态，小蜜蜂将在今日开启集训，而他们将在12月4日的第三赛段亮相舞台。

另一方面关注到赛场，昨日赛前赛事方播放了中国队伍LVG淘汰后的采访，而从选手们的反应中，你可以明显感觉到，上届Major荣耀闯入第三赛段，却在本届Major遗憾止步第一赛段给他们带来的落差。“大家这么支持我？”

昨日，Major第一赛段共结束6场比赛，其中FaZe着实令人捏一把汗。这支本被认为能轻松晋级的银河战舰，在昨日的生死局中被Fnatic推到了悬崖边，一度距离出局仅剩一分之遥。好在frozen的苦苦支撑等来了总监的苏醒，而队伍也在图三回暖，最终惊险拿下生死局的胜利。

当下已有五支队伍晋级第二赛段，今晚十点，六支队伍将对最后三个晋级名额展开角逐。


jackasmo: "When we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time"
Sumljiv
27-11-2025 04:32
The Ukrainian rifler said the change in communication is helping the team.


fnatic have progressed through the StarLadder Budapest Major Stage 1 after a hard-fought victory over NRG, and Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba admits he didn't expect Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele and company to put up such a fight.

"I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier," he told HLTV after the match.

"I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up."

jackasmo also spoke about his adaptation to the team, fnatic's communication, and his expectations for Stage 2.


Listen to the interview here.

You're through 3-1, you got the job done, but it wasn't the easiest game today. I guess it must feel good still, right?

Yes, it was feeling very good. It was good emotions, of course not on the first map. It was kind of rough, but I understood that we'll step up. Each person will step up, me mostly, because I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up.

Considering NRG are playing with a coach, did you expect them to put up such a fight?

Oh, yeah. I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier. Mostly because of the coach, and I didn't know two of their players before this Major. I was thinking it would be easier for sure.

I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier
Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba on playing NRG
When you signed for the team, there was a lot said about the decision making. Did that make it hard to just focus on your CS?

I wouldn't say so. I was feeling pretty normal in all the tournaments. I made some crucial mistakes about my settings, about sensitivity, in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent. We just need to keep going, keep gaining this experience, and everything will be fine. I think there is no pressure about this.

Coming into this new team, you obviously know the IGL, but you have some new roles, some new teammates to get used to. Are you feeling like you know the guys and their protocols?

Firstly, it was pretty rough at the start when I joined the team, because I had three or four completely different roles that I haven't played in my entire career. But each member of the team helped me a lot to be more confident in these roles, also I did a lot of work on these roles and stepped up. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty confident right now.

I made some crucial mistakes about sensitivity in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent
Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba
And how has the communication been? Before you were in Passion UA, who spoke your native tongue, now you speak English. How has that been?

I can see the improvement in this. Right now when we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time, when we are Ukrainian core in the clutch. We are improving in this, because before we didn't do that, we were speaking English all the time, but right now we are gaining every percent in English.

I saw something on Twitter about you guys having different profile pictures in the game to help you see who is alive and when you can start speaking Ukrainian. Is that true?

No, I think it's some fake information. In the game it's not showing, maybe in the observer you can see it, but we didn't mark it.

You are through to Stage 2, where some better teams will enter the competition. Are you still confident to make it through there as well?

We'll do our best. I don't want to jinx anything, but we'll show our best for sure, and we'll grind this period before the second stage, and I'm pretty sure we'll show good results.

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
14:31:04 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14:31:04 | INFO     | **Risk Level:** High
The market is currently experiencing significant volatility as the StarLadder Budapest Major progresses, evidenced by the elimination of regional favorites LVG (dampening Asian market liquidity) and the shaky, near-exit performance of blue-chip asset FaZe Clan.

**Recommendation:** Hold
Investors should maintain positions on premium assets like Vitality and FaZe, as ZywOo's potential "MVP narrative" and Vitality's upcoming Stage 3 appearance offer strong upside, while panic-selling FaZe during their survival phase would be premature.

       I made some crucial mistakes about sensitivity in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent
       Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba
       And how has the communication been? Before you were in Passion UA, who spoke your native tongue, now you speak English. How has that been?
       
       I can see the improvement in this. Right now when we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time, when we are Ukrainian core in the clutch. We are improving in this, because before we didn't do that, we were speaking English all the time, but right now we are gaining every percent in English.
       
       I saw something on Twitter about you guys having different profile pictures in the game to help you see who is alive and when you can start speaking Ukrainian. Is that true?
       
       No, I think it's some fake information. In the game it's not showing, maybe in the observer you can see it, but we didn't mark it.
       
       You are through to Stage 2, where some better teams will enter the competition. Are you still confident to make it through there as well?
       
       We'll do our best. I don't want to jinx anything, but we'll show our best for sure, and we'll grind this period before the second stage, and I'm pretty sure we'll show good results.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       **Risk Level:** High
       The market is currently experiencing significant volatility as the StarLadder Budapest Major progresses, evidenced by the elimination of regional favorites LVG (dampening Asian market liquidity) and the shaky, near-exit performance of blue-chip asset FaZe Clan.
       
       **Recommendation:** Hold
       Investors should maintain positions on premium assets like Vitality and FaZe, as ZywOo's potential "MVP narrative" and Vitality's upcoming Stage 3 appearance offer strong upside, while panic-selling FaZe during their survival phase would be premature.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit, so you should only consider cutting the loss if you anticipate further price decline.
14:32:08 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: 建议继续持有。理由如下：1. 成本陷阱：当前价格0.02为市场底价，卖出后扣除Steam手续费仅能收回约0.01，将导致50%的本金亏损，属于数学上的无效操作。2. 区域流量聚焦：新闻提到中国战队LVG和RA均已淘汰，这将导致亚洲赛区的关注度和资金集中流向仅存的亚洲强队The MongolZ，可能引发‘全村的希望’效应，带来交易量提升。3. 零风险博弈：下行空间已锁死，而Major赛事仍在进行，任何一场胜利都可能推动价格跳涨至0.03，盈亏比极佳。4. 策略建议：在无法更低的情况下，无视情绪波动（25/100），将其作为免费的赛事期权持有到底。

       # News for 20251127
       
       载物欲为Major削发明志，能否完成地狱归来？“我该不该为Major再剃一次光头？”昨日晚间，载物在社媒晒出了自己两年前的光头造型，并向社区提出了这个疑问。而知名主持人Banks则现身评论区，力挺立刻行动。需要说明的是，之所以载物会有剃光头的想法，是因为2023年他曾在巴黎Major前削发明志，并最终以MVP之姿帮助队伍拿下了那届Major冠军。自那之后，社区便有了“光头能给Major加Buff”的小玄学。话说回来，怪不得猎鹰在前日的俱乐部视频中给NiKo整了个光头特效。
       
       此外顺带一提，根据apEX昨日的动态，小蜜蜂将在今日开启集训，而他们将在12月4日的第三赛段亮相舞台。
       
       另一方面关注到赛场，昨日赛前赛事方播放了中国队伍LVG淘汰后的采访，而从选手们的反应中，你可以明显感觉到，上届Major荣耀闯入第三赛段，却在本届Major遗憾止步第一赛段给他们带来的落差。“大家这么支持我？”
       
       昨日，Major第一赛段共结束6场比赛，其中FaZe着实令人捏一把汗。这支本被认为能轻松晋级的银河战舰，在昨日的生死局中被Fnatic推到了悬崖边，一度距离出局仅剩一分之遥。好在frozen的苦苦支撑等来了总监的苏醒，而队伍也在图三回暖，最终惊险拿下生死局的胜利。
       
       当下已有五支队伍晋级第二赛段，今晚十点，六支队伍将对最后三个晋级名额展开角逐。
       
       
       jackasmo: "When we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time"

       27-11-2025 04:32
       The Ukrainian rifler said the change in communication is helping the team.
       
       
       fnatic have progressed through the StarLadder Budapest Major Stage 1 after a hard-fought victory over NRG, and Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba admits he didn't expect Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele and company to put up such a fight.
       
       "I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier," he told HLTV after the match.
       
       "I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up."
       
       jackasmo also spoke about his adaptation to the team, fnatic's communication, and his expectations for Stage 2.
       
       
       Listen to the interview here.
       
       You're through 3-1, you got the job done, but it wasn't the easiest game today. I guess it must feel good still, right?
       
       Yes, it was feeling very good. It was good emotions, of course not on the first map. It was kind of rough, but I understood that we'll step up. Each person will step up, me mostly, because I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up.
       
       Considering NRG are playing with a coach, did you expect them to put up such a fight?
       
       Oh, yeah. I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier. Mostly because of the coach, and I didn't know two of their players before this Major. I was thinking it would be easier for sure.
       
       I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier
       Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba on playing NRG
       When you signed for the team, there was a lot said about the decision making. Did that make it hard to just focus on your CS?
       
       I wouldn't say so. I was feeling pretty normal in all the tournaments. I made some crucial mistakes about my settings, about sensitivity, in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent. We just need to keep going, keep gaining this experience, and everything will be fine. I think there is no pressure about this.
       
       Coming into this new team, you obviously know the IGL, but you have some new roles, some new teammates to get used to. Are you feeling like you know the guys and their protocols?
       
       Firstly, it was pretty rough at the start when I joined the team, because I had three or four completely different roles that I haven't played in my entire career. But each member of the team helped me a lot to be more confident in these roles, also I did a lot of work on these roles and stepped up. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty confident right now.

载物欲为Major削发明志，能否完成地狱归来？“我该不该为Major再剃一次光头？”昨日晚间，载物在社媒晒出了自己两年前的光头造型，并向社区提出了这个疑问。而知名主持人Banks则现身评论区，力挺立刻行动。需要说明的是，之所以载物会有剃光头的想法，是因为2023年他曾在巴黎Major前削发明志，并最终以MVP之姿帮助队伍拿下了那届Major冠军。自那之后，社区便有了“光头能给Major加Buff”的小玄学。话说回来，怪不得猎鹰在前日的俱乐部视频中给NiKo整了个光头特效。

此外顺带一提，根据apEX昨日的动态，小蜜蜂将在今日开启集训，而他们将在12月4日的第三赛段亮相舞台。

另一方面关注到赛场，昨日赛前赛事方播放了中国队伍LVG淘汰后的采访，而从选手们的反应中，你可以明显感觉到，上届Major荣耀闯入第三赛段，却在本届Major遗憾止步第一赛段给他们带来的落差。“大家这么支持我？”

昨日，Major第一赛段共结束6场比赛，其中FaZe着实令人捏一把汗。这支本被认为能轻松晋级的银河战舰，在昨日的生死局中被Fnatic推到了悬崖边，一度距离出局仅剩一分之遥。好在frozen的苦苦支撑等来了总监的苏醒，而队伍也在图三回暖，最终惊险拿下生死局的胜利。

当下已有五支队伍晋级第二赛段，今晚十点，六支队伍将对最后三个晋级名额展开角逐。


jackasmo: "When we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time"

27-11-2025 04:32
The Ukrainian rifler said the change in communication is helping the team.


fnatic have progressed through the StarLadder Budapest Major Stage 1 after a hard-fought victory over NRG, and Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba admits he didn't expect Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele and company to put up such a fight.

"I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier," he told HLTV after the match.

"I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up."

jackasmo also spoke about his adaptation to the team, fnatic's communication, and his expectations for Stage 2.


Listen to the interview here.

You're through 3-1, you got the job done, but it wasn't the easiest game today. I guess it must feel good still, right?

Yes, it was feeling very good. It was good emotions, of course not on the first map. It was kind of rough, but I understood that we'll step up. Each person will step up, me mostly, because I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up.

Considering NRG are playing with a coach, did you expect them to put up such a fight?

Oh, yeah. I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier. Mostly because of the coach, and I didn't know two of their players before this Major. I was thinking it would be easier for sure.

I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier
Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba on playing NRG
When you signed for the team, there was a lot said about the decision making. Did that make it hard to just focus on your CS?

I wouldn't say so. I was feeling pretty normal in all the tournaments. I made some crucial mistakes about my settings, about sensitivity, in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent. We just need to keep going, keep gaining this experience, and everything will be fine. I think there is no pressure about this.

Coming into this new team, you obviously know the IGL, but you have some new roles, some new teammates to get used to. Are you feeling like you know the guys and their protocols?

Firstly, it was pretty rough at the start when I joined the team, because I had three or four completely different roles that I haven't played in my entire career. But each member of the team helped me a lot to be more confident in these roles, also I did a lot of work on these roles and stepped up. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty confident right now.

I made some crucial mistakes about sensitivity in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent
Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba
And how has the communication been? Before you were in Passion UA, who spoke your native tongue, now you speak English. How has that been?

I can see the improvement in this. Right now when we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time, when we are Ukrainian core in the clutch. We are improving in this, because before we didn't do that, we were speaking English all the time, but right now we are gaining every percent in English.

I saw something on Twitter about you guys having different profile pictures in the game to help you see who is alive and when you can start speaking Ukrainian. Is that true?

No, I think it's some fake information. In the game it's not showing, maybe in the observer you can see it, but we didn't mark it.

You are through to Stage 2, where some better teams will enter the competition. Are you still confident to make it through there as well?

We'll do our best. I don't want to jinx anything, but we'll show our best for sure, and we'll grind this period before the second stage, and I'm pretty sure we'll show good results.

14:37:50 | INFO     | **Risk Level: Moderate**

The early elimination of LVG significantly reduces liquidity from the Chinese market sector, while the shaky performance of high-cap asset FaZe Clan introduces volatility despite their survival. With the Major still in its initial stages and Vitality entering later, current asset prices reflect temporary tournament hype rather than established long-term value. **Recommendation: Hold** existing positions on surviving teams to capitalize on short-term sentiment, but avoid new capital entry until the inevitable post-tournament price correction.

14:42:34 | INFO     | Alright, let's break down the CS2 sticker market based on this news.

1.  **Risk Assessment:** The market currently presents a moderate risk. The Major is underway, which usually generates sticker demand and price volatility. However, team performance (FaZe's near elimination, LVG's underperformance) and roster changes (jackasmo adapting to fnatic) can significantly impact sticker values, creating uncertainty.

2.  **Recommendation:** **Hold.** The news doesn't provide a clear catalyst for a significant price surge or crash. The Major is ongoing, and we need to see how teams perform in the next stages to determine the long-term desirability of their stickers. The "光头能给Major加Buff" is a social sentiment and has no financial basis.

昨日，Major第一赛段共结束6场比赛，其中FaZe着实令人捏一把汗。这支本被认为能轻松晋级的银河战舰，在昨日的生死局中被Fnatic推到了悬崖边，一度距离出局仅剩一分之遥。好在frozen的苦苦支撑等来了总监的苏醒，而队伍也在图三回暖，最终惊险拿下生死局的胜利。

当下已有五支队伍晋级第二赛段，今晚十点，六支队伍将对最后三个晋级名额展开角逐。


jackasmo: "When we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time"

The Ukrainian rifler said the change in communication is helping the team.


fnatic have progressed through the StarLadder Budapest Major Stage 1 after a hard-fought victory over NRG, and Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba admits he didn't expect Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele and company to put up such a fight.

"I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier," he told HLTV after the match.

"I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up."

jackasmo also spoke about his adaptation to the team, fnatic's communication, and his expectations for Stage 2.


Listen to the interview here.

You're through 3-1, you got the job done, but it wasn't the easiest game today. I guess it must feel good still, right?

Yes, it was feeling very good. It was good emotions, of course not on the first map. It was kind of rough, but I understood that we'll step up. Each person will step up, me mostly, because I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up.

Considering NRG are playing with a coach, did you expect them to put up such a fight?

Oh, yeah. I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier. Mostly because of the coach, and I didn't know two of their players before this Major. I was thinking it would be easier for sure.

I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier
Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba on playing NRG
When you signed for the team, there was a lot said about the decision making. Did that make it hard to just focus on your CS?

I wouldn't say so. I was feeling pretty normal in all the tournaments. I made some crucial mistakes about my settings, about sensitivity, in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent. We just need to keep going, keep gaining this experience, and everything will be fine. I think there is no pressure about this.

Coming into this new team, you obviously know the IGL, but you have some new roles, some new teammates to get used to. Are you feeling like you know the guys and their protocols?

Firstly, it was pretty rough at the start when I joined the team, because I had three or four completely different roles that I haven't played in my entire career. But each member of the team helped me a lot to be more confident in these roles, also I did a lot of work on these roles and stepped up. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty confident right now.

I made some crucial mistakes about sensitivity in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent
Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba
And how has the communication been? Before you were in Passion UA, who spoke your native tongue, now you speak English. How has that been?

I can see the improvement in this. Right now when we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time, when we are Ukrainian core in the clutch. We are improving in this, because before we didn't do that, we were speaking English all the time, but right now we are gaining every percent in English.

I saw something on Twitter about you guys having different profile pictures in the game to help you see who is alive and when you can start speaking Ukrainian. Is that true?

No, I think it's some fake information. In the game it's not showing, maybe in the observer you can see it, but we didn't mark it.

You are through to Stage 2, where some better teams will enter the competition. Are you still confident to make it through there as well?

We'll do our best. I don't want to jinx anything, but we'll show our best for sure, and we'll grind this period before the second stage, and I'm pretty sure we'll show good results.

15:00:09 | INFO     | The market is currently experiencing localized volatility as the elimination of Chinese underdog LVG triggers a liquidity exit from regional stickers, while Fnatic’s 3-1 advancement and the "shaved head" hype surrounding ZywOo are driving speculative inflows into European core assets. Risk is assessed as high-moderate, dictated by the precarious form of "silver-chip" teams like FaZe and the impending entry of top-tier organizations into Stage 2. My recommendation is to **HOLD** Vitality and FaZe positions to capture Stage 2 hype, while selectively **BUYING** Fnatic stickers as a momentum play before their Stage 2 performance is fully priced in.

       With a minor 2.30% loss, taking profit is impossible, and it is generally better to hold through minor volatility rather than cutting losses prematurely.
15:00:49 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前作为亚洲赛区的领头羊，在LVG被淘汰后，其作为亚洲‘独苗’的稀缺性和关注度在接下来的第二赛段中会进一步放大。当前价格 0.02 已处于市场底价区间，几乎没有下行风险。考虑到盈亏平衡且持仓仅14天，随着第二赛段（Stage 2）的开启，该战队的表现极有可能带动印花价格上涨，此时持有是风险收益比最优的选择。

       I made some crucial mistakes about sensitivity in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent
       Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba
       And how has the communication been? Before you were in Passion UA, who spoke your native tongue, now you speak English. How has that been?
       
       I can see the improvement in this. Right now when we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time, when we are Ukrainian core in the clutch. We are improving in this, because before we didn't do that, we were speaking English all the time, but right now we are gaining every percent in English.
       
       I saw something on Twitter about you guys having different profile pictures in the game to help you see who is alive and when you can start speaking Ukrainian. Is that true?
       
       No, I think it's some fake information. In the game it's not showing, maybe in the observer you can see it, but we didn't mark it.
       
       You are through to Stage 2, where some better teams will enter the competition. Are you still confident to make it through there as well?
       
       We'll do our best. I don't want to jinx anything, but we'll show our best for sure, and we'll grind this period before the second stage, and I'm pretty sure we'll show good results.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing localized volatility as the elimination of Chinese underdog LVG triggers a liquidity exit from regional stickers, while Fnatic’s 3-1 advancement and the "shaved head" hype surrounding ZywOo are driving speculative inflows into European core assets. Risk is assessed as high-moderate, dictated by the precarious form of "silver-chip" teams like FaZe and the impending entry of top-tier organizations into Stage 2. My recommendation is to **HOLD** Vitality and FaZe positions to capture Stage 2 hype, while selectively **BUYING** Fnatic stickers as a momentum play before their Stage 2 performance is fully priced in.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a marginal 1.02% gain, it is generally better to hold for higher targets as there is currently no reason to cut a loss.
15:01:08 | INFO     |     -> Decision for MOUZ: HOLD, Reason: MOUZ 属于市场分析报告中提到的‘欧洲核心资产’。虽然当前面临 8.26% 的浮亏，但随着 Major 第一赛段结束，市场资金正从被淘汰的弱旅（如 LVG）流向像 MOUZ 这样即将进入第二赛段的顶级战队。目前 50/100 的情绪评分显示市场处于博弈期，在第二赛段（Stage 2）开赛前，顶级战队的印花通常会迎来一波热度回升。此时卖出将锁定亏损，建议持有以捕捉后续赛段带来的价格反弹机会。

       载物欲为Major削发明志，能否完成地狱归来？“我该不该为Major再剃一次光头？”昨日晚间，载物在社媒晒出了自己两年前的光头造型，并向社区提出了这个疑问。而知名主持人Banks则现身评论区，力挺立刻行动。需要说明的是，之所以载物会有剃光头的想法，是因为2023年他曾在巴黎Major前削发明志，并最终以MVP之姿帮助队伍拿下了那届Major冠军。自那之后，社区便有了“光头能给Major加Buff”的小玄学。话说回来，怪不得猎鹰在前日的俱乐部视频中给NiKo整了个光头特效。
       
       此外顺带一提，根据apEX昨日的动态，小蜜蜂将在今日开启集训，而他们将在12月4日的第三赛段亮相舞台。
       
       另一方面关注到赛场，昨日赛前赛事方播放了中国队伍LVG淘汰后的采访，而从选手们的反应中，你可以明显感觉到，上届Major荣耀闯入第三赛段，却在本届Major遗憾止步第一赛段给他们带来的落差。“大家这么支持我？”
       
       昨日，Major第一赛段共结束6场比赛，其中FaZe着实令人捏一把汗。这支本被认为能轻松晋级的银河战舰，在昨日的生死局中被Fnatic推到了悬崖边，一度距离出局仅剩一分之遥。好在frozen的苦苦支撑等来了总监的苏醒，而队伍也在图三回暖，最终惊险拿下生死局的胜利。
       
       当下已有五支队伍晋级第二赛段，今晚十点，六支队伍将对最后三个晋级名额展开角逐。
       
       
       jackasmo: "When we are as a three, we are speaking Ukrainian all the time"
       Sumljiv
       27-11-2025 04:32
       The Ukrainian rifler said the change in communication is helping the team.
       
       
       fnatic have progressed through the StarLadder Budapest Major Stage 1 after a hard-fought victory over NRG, and Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba admits he didn't expect Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele and company to put up such a fight.
       
       "I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier," he told HLTV after the match.
       
       "I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up."
       
       jackasmo also spoke about his adaptation to the team, fnatic's communication, and his expectations for Stage 2.
       
       
       Listen to the interview here.
       
       You're through 3-1, you got the job done, but it wasn't the easiest game today. I guess it must feel good still, right?
       
       Yes, it was feeling very good. It was good emotions, of course not on the first map. It was kind of rough, but I understood that we'll step up. Each person will step up, me mostly, because I was pretty off on the first map, and after that, we just managed to come back up.
       
       Considering NRG are playing with a coach, did you expect them to put up such a fight?
       
       Oh, yeah. I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier. Mostly because of the coach, and I didn't know two of their players before this Major. I was thinking it would be easier for sure.
       
       I don't want to badmouth or anything, but I was thinking it would be easier
       Nikita "⁠jackasmo⁠" Skyba on playing NRG
       When you signed for the team, there was a lot said about the decision making. Did that make it hard to just focus on your CS?
       
       I wouldn't say so. I was feeling pretty normal in all the tournaments. I made some crucial mistakes about my settings, about sensitivity, in the previous tournament, but right now I'm feeling very consistent. We just need to keep going, keep gaining this experience, and everything will be fine. I think there is no pressure about this.
       
       Coming into this new team, you obviously know the IGL, but you have some new roles, some new teammates to get used to. Are you feeling like you know the guys and their protocols?
       
       Firstly, it was pretty rough at the start when I joined the team, because I had three or four completely different roles that I haven't played in my entire career. But each member of the team helped me a lot to be more confident in these roles, also I did a lot of work on these roles and stepped up. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty confident right now.

As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
MIRAA
28-11-2025 19:00
Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.


The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
"I was so fucking right about it."

Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.

The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."


Read more
ESL to suspend Impact circuit
vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."

Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.

In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.

When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."

At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."


A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.

"Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."

Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.

At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.

This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.

"I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."

Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.

"It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.

"And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."

In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.


After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
"For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.

"So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.

"It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.

"Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."

With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.

The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.

FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.


Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.

VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.

"We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."


But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.

There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.

"Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.

"Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.

"We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.

"The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."


Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.

"The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.

"The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.

"Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."


Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.

Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.

The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.

"Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"

Mixed feelings
FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."

"We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.

"North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."


GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.

"That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.

"Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."

Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.

"It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.

"It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."


flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.

"We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."

As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.

"I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."

"I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.

"I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."

At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.

This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.

"I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."

       As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
       MIRAA
       28-11-2025 19:00
       Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.
       
       
       The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
       "I was so fucking right about it."
       
       Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.
       
       The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

       ESL to suspend Impact circuit
       vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."
       
       Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.
       
       In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.
       
       When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."
       
       At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."
       
       
       A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
       If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.
       
       "Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."
       
       Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.
       
       At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.
       
       This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.
       
       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.

I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.

       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing.

       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.
       
       "Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"
       
       Mixed feelings
       FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."
       
       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."
       
       
       GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
       vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.
       
       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."
       
       
       flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
       Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.
       
       "We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.
       
       "I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."
       
       "I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.
       
       "I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."
       
       At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.
       
       This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.
       
       "I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is not an option, and a minor 2.88% decline typically suggests holding rather than cutting loss unless you anticipate a further significant downturn.
15:02:46 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前处于盈亏平衡状态（0.00%），由于饰品交易平台普遍存在手续费（如Steam 15%或第三方平台2%-5%），此时卖出实际上会导致净亏损。从基本面看，The MongolZ 是亚洲赛区的领头羊且已晋级下一阶段，随着 Major 进入第二赛段，其曝光度和话题性将持续增加。市场分析报告也建议持有 Major 相关头寸以捕获赛事红利。在没有明显利空且由于手续费导致‘卖出即亏损’的情况下，继续持有等待赛段热度溢价是更明智的选择。

       As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
       MIRAA
       28-11-2025 19:00
       Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.
       
       
       The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
       "I was so fucking right about it."
       
       Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.
       
       The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

       ESL to suspend Impact circuit
       vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."
       
       Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.
       
       In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.
       
       When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."
       
       At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."
       
       
       A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
       If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.
       
       "Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."
       
       Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.
       
       At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.
       
       This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.
       
       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.
       
       "It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.
       
       FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.
       
       
       Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
       FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.
       
       VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.
       
       "We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."
       
       
       But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.
       
       There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.
       
       "Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.
       
       "Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.
       
       "We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.
       
       "The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."
       
       
       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.
       
       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.

       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."

       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."

       Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.
       
       "We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at breakeven, it is best to hold the asset because selling now would likely result in a net loss after transaction fees.

       As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
       MIRAA
       28-11-2025 19:00
       Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.
       
       
       The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
       "I was so fucking right about it."
       
       Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.
       
       The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

       ESL to suspend Impact circuit
       vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."
       
       Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.
       
       In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.
       
       When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."
       
       At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."
       
       
       A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
       If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.
       
       "Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."
       
       Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.
       
       At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.
       
       This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.
       
       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.
       
       "It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.
       
       FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.
       
       
       Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
       FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.
       
       VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.
       
       "We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."
       
       
       But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.
       
       There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.
       
       "Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.
       
       "Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.
       
       "We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.
       
       "The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."
       
       
       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.
       
       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.
       
       "Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"
       
       Mixed feelings
       FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."
       
       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."
       
       
       GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
       vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.
       
       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."
       
       
       flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
       Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.
       
       "We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.
       
       "I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."
       
       "I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.
       
       "I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."
       
       At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.
       
       This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.
       
       "I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a negligible loss of 1.02%, there is no profit to take, and the dip likely represents minor market volatility rather than a definitive reason to cut losses.
15:03:11 | INFO     |     -> Decision for MOUZ: HOLD, Reason: MOUZ 作为顶级战队，属于 Major 核心资产。虽然目前面临 9.17% 的账面亏损，但 Major 第一赛段刚刚结束，市场正处于资金轮动期。根据分析师报告，建议持有 Major 核心头寸以捕捉后续赛段的赛事红利。MOUZ 尚未在第二/三赛段正式亮相，随着其比赛的开启，市场曝光度和粉丝需求有望回升。此时卖出将锁定近 10% 的亏损，在 Major 尚未完结且战队表现未定之前，建议耐心持有等待反弹。

       As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
       MIRAA
       28-11-2025 19:00
       Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.
       
       
       The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
       "I was so fucking right about it."
       
       Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.
       
       The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

       ESL to suspend Impact circuit
       vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."
       
       Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.
       
       In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.
       
       When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."
       
       At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."
       
       
       A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
       If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.
       
       "Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."
       
       Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.
       
       At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.
       
       This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.
       
       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.
       
       "It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.
       
       FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.
       
       
       Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
       FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.
       
       VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.
       
       "We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."
       
       
       But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.
       
       There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.
       
       "Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.
       
       "Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.
       
       "We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.
       
       "The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."
       
       
       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.
       
       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.
       
       "Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"
       
       Mixed feelings
       FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."
       
       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."
       
       
       GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
       vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.
       
       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."
       
       
       flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
       Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.
       
       "We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.
       
       "I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."
       
       "I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.
       
       "I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."
       
       At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.
       
       This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.
       
       "I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, hold for a potential recovery rather than realizing a loss on a minor 9% dip.
15:03:22 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: HOLD, Reason: Spirit 目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.00%），且今日情绪评分高达 78/100，显示市场对其极度看好。作为夺冠大热门，Spirit 尚未在 Major 的核心赛段亮相，其印花价值通常会在战队登场并取得连胜时达到峰值。此外，Spirit 提议制作队标挂件的新闻增加了品牌话题度。考虑到当前卖出需支付平台手续费会导致实际亏损，且分析师建议持有 Major 核心头寸以博取后续赛段的红利，建议继续持有。

       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.
       
       "It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.
       
       FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.
       
       
       Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
       FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.
       
       VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.
       
       "We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."
       
       
       But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.
       
       There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.
       
       "Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.
       
       "Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.
       
       "We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.
       
       "The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."
       
       
       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.
       
       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.
       
       "Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"
       
       Mixed feelings
       FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."
       
       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."
       
       
       GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
       vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.
       
       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."
       
       
       flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
       Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.
       
       "We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.
       
       "I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."
       
       "I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.
       
       "I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."
       
       At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.
       
       This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.
       
       "I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are at a break-even point with 0% PnL, there is currently no profit to take or loss to cut, making it a neutral hold until a clear price trend develops.
15:03:35 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FURIA: HOLD, Reason: FURIA作为高人气巴西战队，其印花属于Major期间的核心流动资产。目前5.44%的亏损处于赛事初期的正常波动范围内。根据财务分析报告，建议持有Major核心头寸以捕捉后续赛段的赛事红利和炒作热度。随着比赛进入曝光度更高的第二/三阶段，巴西庞大的粉丝群体可能带动价格反弹。此时卖出将锁定亏损，建议继续持有等待赛事高峰期的离场时机。

       As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
       MIRAA
       28-11-2025 19:00
       Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.
       
       
       The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
       "I was so fucking right about it."
       
       Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.
       
       The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

       ESL to suspend Impact circuit
       vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."
       
       Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.
       
       In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.
       
       When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."
       
       At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."
       
       
       A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
       If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.
       
       "Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."
       
       Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.
       
       At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.
       
       This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.
       
       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.
       
       "It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.

       VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.
       
       "We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."
       
       
       But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.
       
       There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.
       
       "Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.
       
       "Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.
       
       "We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.
       
       "The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."
       
       
       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.
       
       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.
       
       "Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"
       
       Mixed feelings
       FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."
       
       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."
       
       
       GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
       vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.
       
       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."
       
       
       flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
       Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.
       
       "We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.
       
       "I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."
       
       "I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.
       
       "I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."
       
       At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.
       
       This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.
       
       "I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is not an option; you should only consider cutting losses if the asset breaches your predetermined risk threshold or if its market outlook has fundamentally worsened.
15:03:46 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Vitality: HOLD, Reason: Vitality 作为本届 Major 的夺冠热门及‘核心资产’，目前尚未在赛场正式亮相（预计 12 月 4 日进入第三赛段）。虽然目前账面亏损 9.57%，但今日情绪评分高达 90/100，显示市场对该战队及其核心选手 ZywOo 抱有极高期待。根据分析师报告，建议持有核心 Major 头寸以捕捉后续赛段的炒作红利。在战队尚未登场且社区情绪极度看涨的情况下，此时卖出属于提前割肉，建议继续持有，等待第二、三赛段开赛后的热度爆发及价格反弹。

       As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
       MIRAA
       28-11-2025 19:00
       Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.
       
       
       The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
       "I was so fucking right about it."
       
       Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.
       
       The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

       ESL to suspend Impact circuit
       vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."
       
       Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.
       
       In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.
       
       When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."
       
       At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."
       
       
       A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
       If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.
       
       "Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."
       
       Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.
       
       At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.
       
       This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.
       
       "I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."
       
       Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.
       
       "It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.
       
       "And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."
       
       In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.
       
       
       After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
       "For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.
       
       "So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.
       
       "It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.
       
       "Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."
       
       With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.
       
       The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.
       
       FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.
       
       
       Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
       FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.
       
       VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.
       
       "We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."
       
       
       But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.
       
       There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.
       
       "Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.
       
       "Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.
       
       "We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.
       
       "The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."
       
       
       Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.
       
       "The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.
       
       "The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.
       
       "Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."
       
       
       Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
       Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.
       
       Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.
       
       The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.

       "We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.
       
       "North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."

       "That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.
       
       "Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."
       
       Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.
       
       "It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.
       
       "It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."

"This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."
       
       As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.

       "I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."
       
       At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.
       
       This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.
       
       "I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility as the Budapest Major progresses, with strong "comeback" narratives for FaZe and PARIVISION driving speculative demand for their respective stickers. Risk is categorized as **High** due to the indefinite suspension of the ESL Impact circuit signaling broader economic fragility in the esports sector, alongside potential market dilution if Spirit’s team-branded charm proposal is implemented. My recommendation is to **Hold** core Major positions to capitalize on tournament hype while selectively **Buying** PARIVISION items as a high-upside play following their successful Stage 1 performance.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, you cannot take profit; consider cutting your loss if the price hits your predetermined risk threshold or if the asset's outlook remains negative.

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       You cannot take profit while in the red, and a 2.88% dip is generally too marginal to justify cutting losses unless you anticipate a significant further decline in the asset's value.
15:04:29 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.02），且该价格已处于市场底价区间。根据最新的财务分析报告，市场正处于横盘整理期，缺乏波动。由于饰品交易存在手续费损耗，此时平价卖出实际上会产生净亏损。考虑到 The MongolZ 在 Major 赛事中的活跃表现及其作为亚洲赛区领头羊的地位，在没有新利空消息的情况下，持有等待下一波赛事热度或市场催化剂是更合理的风险管理策略。

Short: FACEIT's Leagues Manager clarifies rule on orgs with multiple teams competing in ESEA
Since the restructuring of the ESEA league system, some confusion has arisen around the rules surrounding organizations with multiple teams, for example a main team and an academy or female team.


Read more
ESEA League reworked to once again be path to ESL Challenger League
A question was raised on whether academy teams could compete in ESEA if they were in the same region as their main team.


HLTV contacted FACEIT's Leagues & Tournaments Product Manager, Kamil "r00cky" Plichta, for clarification. The rule only applies to teams competing in Open up to Advanced, so if your main team is in ECL or EPL, you are not violating the rules.

"You need to treat eg Advanced-Open9-10 as one pool of teams (or in valve terms, one competition)," Kamil said. "Meaning that two teams, eg FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED cannot both participate in groups between Advanced and Open9-10.

"I think an easy way to explain it is how VRS invites work, using the same example, if FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED both get the invitation to a single event, only one can accept the invite."

15:05:31 | INFO     | The market is currently experiencing high volatility and elevated speculative risk as the StarLadder Budapest Major moves into the high-stakes playoff qualifications. FaZe Clan’s dominant 3-0 recovery in Stage 2 has solidified them as a primary liquidity driver, while roster instability in organizations like Betclic suggests a cooling interest in mid-tier Polish stickers. **HOLD** high-momentum playoff contenders like FaZe to capitalize on peak "Champions Stage" hype, but **SELL** underperforming Stage 1 and Stage 2 assets now to lock in margins before the post-Major supply saturation.

15:05:46 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
15:05:57 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 100 Thieves 属于绝版（Legacy）印花，其价值受当前 Major 赛事胜负的直接影响较小，更多取决于市场整体流动性和稀缺性。目前 2.88% 的亏损比例极低，在 19 天的持仓周期内属于正常波动。虽然分析师建议卖出表现不佳的本届参赛战队资产，但 100 Thieves 作为高价值收藏品，在 Major 带来的整体市场热度下具有较好的抗风险能力。考虑到交易手续费损耗，此时卖出并非明智之举，建议继续持有以等待长期价值回归。

       Short: FACEIT's Leagues Manager clarifies rule on orgs with multiple teams competing in ESEA
       Since the restructuring of the ESEA league system, some confusion has arisen around the rules surrounding organizations with multiple teams, for example a main team and an academy or female team.

       ESEA League reworked to once again be path to ESL Challenger League
       A question was raised on whether academy teams could compete in ESEA if they were in the same region as their main team.
       
       
       HLTV contacted FACEIT's Leagues & Tournaments Product Manager, Kamil "r00cky" Plichta, for clarification. The rule only applies to teams competing in Open up to Advanced, so if your main team is in ECL or EPL, you are not violating the rules.
       
       "You need to treat eg Advanced-Open9-10 as one pool of teams (or in valve terms, one competition)," Kamil said. "Meaning that two teams, eg FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED cannot both participate in groups between Advanced and Open9-10.
       
       "I think an easy way to explain it is how VRS invites work, using the same example, if FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED both get the invitation to a single event, only one can accept the invite."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility and elevated speculative risk as the StarLadder Budapest Major moves into the high-stakes playoff qualifications. FaZe Clan’s dominant 3-0 recovery in Stage 2 has solidified them as a primary liquidity driver, while roster instability in organizations like Betclic suggests a cooling interest in mid-tier Polish stickers. **HOLD** high-momentum playoff contenders like FaZe to capitalize on peak "Champions Stage" hype, but **SELL** underperforming Stage 1 and Stage 2 assets now to lock in margins before the post-Major supply saturation.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is impossible, and a minor 2.88% dip is generally too small to justify cutting losses unless you expect the asset's value to continue dropping significantly.
15:06:10 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.02），且该价格通常为印花的市场底价。考虑到饰品交易平台的手续费，此时卖出将导致实际净亏损。根据财务分析报告，市场目前处于 Major 第二赛段向淘汰赛过度的关键期，建议持有具备晋级潜力的战队印花。The MongolZ 作为亚洲赛区的领头羊，在本次 Major 中表现活跃，仍有博取‘冠军赛阶段’（Champions Stage）溢价红利的空间。在战队尚未出局且价格处于底部的情况下，持有是风险收益比更高的决策。

15:06:21 | INFO     |     -> Decision for HEROIC: HOLD, Reason: HEROIC 目前处于 1.02% 的微利状态，但在扣除交易平台手续费后实际仍处于盈亏平衡甚至微亏。当前 Major 正处于第二赛段向淘汰赛过渡的关键期，市场情绪中性。根据财务分析建议，应持有具备冲击淘汰赛潜力的核心战队头寸。HEROIC 仍有晋级‘冠军赛阶段’的机会，届时其印花价格通常会出现明显的溢价。在战队表现尚未定论且当前利润空间极小的情况下，继续持有以等待赛事热度达峰是更优的策略。

       Since the restructuring of the ESEA league system, some confusion has arisen around the rules surrounding organizations with multiple teams, for example a main team and an academy or female team.

       ESEA League reworked to once again be path to ESL Challenger League
       A question was raised on whether academy teams could compete in ESEA if they were in the same region as their main team.
       
       
       HLTV contacted FACEIT's Leagues & Tournaments Product Manager, Kamil "r00cky" Plichta, for clarification. The rule only applies to teams competing in Open up to Advanced, so if your main team is in ECL or EPL, you are not violating the rules.
       
       "You need to treat eg Advanced-Open9-10 as one pool of teams (or in valve terms, one competition)," Kamil said. "Meaning that two teams, eg FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED cannot both participate in groups between Advanced and Open9-10.
       
       "I think an easy way to explain it is how VRS invites work, using the same example, if FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED both get the invitation to a single event, only one can accept the invite."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility and elevated speculative risk as the StarLadder Budapest Major moves into the high-stakes playoff qualifications. FaZe Clan’s dominant 3-0 recovery in Stage 2 has solidified them as a primary liquidity driver, while roster instability in organizations like Betclic suggests a cooling interest in mid-tier Polish stickers. **HOLD** high-momentum playoff contenders like FaZe to capitalize on peak "Champions Stage" hype, but **SELL** underperforming Stage 1 and Stage 2 assets now to lock in margins before the post-Major supply saturation.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a marginal gain of 1.02%, it is generally better to hold for more significant momentum rather than exiting for a negligible profit.
15:06:30 | INFO     |     -> Decision for MOUZ: HOLD, Reason: MOUZ 目前面临 9.17% 的账面亏损，但其作为传统强队，在 Major 的关键赛段（第二、三阶段）通常具备较强的吸粉能力和竞技表现。财务分析报告虽然建议卖出表现不佳的资产，但同时也强调应持有高动量的核心头寸。MOUZ 尚未表现出彻底溃败的迹象，且目前正处于赛事热度爬升期。此时卖出将锁定较大亏损，建议持有观望其在即将到来的淘汰赛资格争夺中的表现，博取回本或减亏的机会。

       Since you are currently at a loss, you should consider cutting your loss if you expect the price to continue dropping or holding if you anticipate a market recovery.
15:06:42 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: HOLD, Reason: Spirit 作为本届 Major 的头号夺冠热门之一，属于财务分析报告中提到的“高动量季后赛竞争者”。目前仅有 1.60% 的轻微浮亏，且今日情绪评分保持在 70/100 的高位，显示市场对其极具信心。随着赛事进入高标准的淘汰赛资格争夺阶段，Spirit 的曝光度和印花需求预计将达到峰值。根据报告建议，应持有此类核心资产以博取“冠军赛阶段”的热度红利，此时卖出并非最佳时机。

       With a minor 1.6% unrealized loss, there is no profit to take, and cutting loss now would likely be premature unless the asset's technical trend or fundamentals have significantly deteriorated.
15:06:51 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FURIA: HOLD, Reason: FURIA 目前仅面临 1.43% 的轻微浮亏，价格相对稳定。随着 Major 进入第二赛段的高潮，巴西战队的巨大粉丝基数往往会为印花价格提供支撑。财务分析报告建议持有高动量的核心资产以捕捉“冠军赛阶段”的热度红利。尽管目前情绪中性，但 FURIA 作为具有竞争力的战队，在接下来争夺季后赛名额的过程中仍有较大的市场上涨潜力。此时卖出并无必要，建议继续持有以博取赛事后期的潜在反弹。

       "I think an easy way to explain it is how VRS invites work, using the same example, if FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED both get the invitation to a single event, only one can accept the invite."
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently experiencing high volatility and elevated speculative risk as the StarLadder Budapest Major moves into the high-stakes playoff qualifications. FaZe Clan’s dominant 3-0 recovery in Stage 2 has solidified them as a primary liquidity driver, while roster instability in organizations like Betclic suggests a cooling interest in mid-tier Polish stickers. **HOLD** high-momentum playoff contenders like FaZe to capitalize on peak "Champions Stage" hype, but **SELL** underperforming Stage 1 and Stage 2 assets now to lock in margins before the post-Major supply saturation.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a minor loss, it is generally better to hold for a recovery rather than cutting loss on a small 1.43% price fluctuation.
15:07:02 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Vitality: HOLD, Reason: Vitality 是本届 Major 的核心夺冠热门，属于财务分析报告中明确建议持有的“高动量季后赛竞争者”。虽然目前面临 10% 的账面亏损，但 87/100 的极高情绪评分表明市场对其后续表现（尤其是即将开始的第三赛段）抱有极大期待。根据 FaZe 3-0 晋级引发的市场回暖效应，同级别的顶级强队 Vitality 的印花在正式亮相后极具补涨潜力。此时卖出属于在利好兑现前割肉，建议继续持有以捕捉“冠军赛阶段”的热度峰值。

       Short: NEO: "A dream scenario that has come true"
       In a post on X, Filip "⁠NEO⁠" Kubski spoke about FaZe's incredible bounceback at the Budapest Major as they went 3-0 in Stage 2 after almost not making it out of Stage 1.
       
       "The toughest stage is ahead of us to reach the playoffs, but this team is capable of anything."

       Short: FACEIT's Leagues Manager clarifies rule on orgs with multiple teams competing in ESEA
       Since the restructuring of the ESEA league system, some confusion has arisen around the rules surrounding organizations with multiple teams, for example a main team and an academy or female team.

       ESEA League reworked to once again be path to ESL Challenger League
       A question was raised on whether academy teams could compete in ESEA if they were in the same region as their main team.
       
       
       HLTV contacted FACEIT's Leagues & Tournaments Product Manager, Kamil "r00cky" Plichta, for clarification. The rule only applies to teams competing in Open up to Advanced, so if your main team is in ECL or EPL, you are not violating the rules.

15:08:36 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Sashi: HOLD, Reason: 虽然 Sashi 印花目前面临 18.86% 的较大亏损，但最新的财务分析报告明确建议在当前缺乏市场催化剂的停滞期‘持有’以保留资本。目前市场处于价格整合和流动性较低的阶段，此时强行卖出不仅会锁定大幅亏损，还可能卖在市场情绪的真空期。考虑到今日情绪评分为中性（50/100），且市场整体处于横盘震荡，建议遵循专业分析建议，暂时持有头寸，等待 Major 赛事后续动态或新公告提供的明确方向。

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The current risk level is assessed as moderate, as the total lack of fresh market catalysts suggests a period of price consolidation and diminished volatility. Without new data or tournament updates to drive speculation, the market is likely to remain stagnant as organic demand balances existing supply. Consequently, the financial recommendation is to **Hold** current positions to preserve capital until a significant news event provides a clearer directional trend.

Sources: gla1ve set to join 100 Thieves as coach
MIRAA
3-12-2025 18:00
The Danish former professional player is beginning his coaching career with a big project.


Former Astralis and ENCE captain is on the brink of joining 100 Thieves as head coach, multiple sources told HLTV. The news comes less than two weeks after the 30-year-old announced his retirement from playing to become a coach.

Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander will become the second piece of 100 Thieves' new squad after Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, who was signed from FaZe last month.

gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
100 Thieves have also hired Graham "⁠messioso⁠" Pitt as Head of CS Operations and Sean "⁠seang@res⁠" Gares as Head of FPS to oversee the organization's return to the game after a five-year absence.

Shortly after announcing their re-entry, 100 Thieves were rumored to be interested in signing GamerLegion's core.

I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer in this role
Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander told HLTV in an interview
Nicolas Reber, GamerLegion's founder and CEO, confirmed that there had been talks with the North American organization but said that, at the time, there were "no active discussions" about the sale of any of the team's players or a core.

100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.

15:10:22 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:10:22 | INFO     | 1. The risk level is Medium-High, as the return of a premier brand like 100 Thieves triggers intense speculative volatility and threatens the long-term scarcity premium of their legacy sticker sets.
2. Recommendation: **HOLD** existing 100T legacy stickers to capitalize on the immediate "hype" rally, while selectively **BUYING** rain (FaZe) and GamerLegion player stickers before the roster transition is fully finalized.
3. The strategic re-entry of 100 Thieves led by gla1ve will significantly boost brand-related liquidity, though the eventual influx of new 2026 sticker supply will likely cap the appreciation of older assets.

       The Danish former professional player is beginning his coaching career with a big project.
       
       
       Former Astralis and ENCE captain is on the brink of joining 100 Thieves as head coach, multiple sources told HLTV. The news comes less than two weeks after the 30-year-old announced his retirement from playing to become a coach.
       
       Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander will become the second piece of 100 Thieves' new squad after Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, who was signed from FaZe last month.

       gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
       100 Thieves have also hired Graham "⁠messioso⁠" Pitt as Head of CS Operations and Sean "⁠seang@res⁠" Gares as Head of FPS to oversee the organization's return to the game after a five-year absence.
       
       Shortly after announcing their re-entry, 100 Thieves were rumored to be interested in signing GamerLegion's core.
       
       I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer in this role
       Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander told HLTV in an interview
       Nicolas Reber, GamerLegion's founder and CEO, confirmed that there had been talks with the North American organization but said that, at the time, there were "no active discussions" about the sale of any of the team's players or a core.
       
       100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The risk level is Medium-High, as the return of a premier brand like 100 Thieves triggers intense speculative volatility and threatens the long-term scarcity premium of their legacy sticker sets.
       2. Recommendation: **HOLD** existing 100T legacy stickers to capitalize on the immediate "hype" rally, while selectively **BUYING** rain (FaZe) and GamerLegion player stickers before the roster transition is fully finalized.
       3. The strategic re-entry of 100 Thieves led by gla1ve will significantly boost brand-related liquidity, though the eventual influx of new 2026 sticker supply will likely cap the appreciation of older assets.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       You cannot take profit while at a loss, so it is generally better to hold for a recovery rather than cutting loss on a relatively minor 3.45% dip.
15:10:54 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.02），价格处于此类印花的底价区间。虽然今日市场焦点集中在 100 Thieves 的回归上，但 Major 赛事仍在进行中，The MongolZ 作为亚洲赛区的核心战队仍具备潜在的话题性。考虑到交易手续费损耗，此时平价卖出实际上会导致净亏损。在风险极低且市场底价支撑强劲的情况下，持有头寸等待后续赛事或市场整体流动性回暖是更稳健的选择。

       Since you are currently at a 2.80% loss, taking profit is not possible, so you should consider cutting your loss only if the price drops below your predetermined risk threshold or if the underlying investment thesis has changed.
15:11:18 | INFO     |     -> Decision for FURIA: SELL, Reason: FURIA 目前已实现 8.85% 的收益。虽然 100 Thieves 的回归提振了市场流动性，但财务分析报告同时指出这种重磅消息会带来‘剧烈的投机性波动’。考虑到今日情绪评分为中性（50/100），且市场焦点正在快速向 100T 及其潜在签约战队转移，FURIA 作为非直接受益战队，其短期涨幅可能面临回调风险。落袋为安锁定近 9% 的利润是理性的交易决策，可以为后续布局 100T 回归相关的资产腾出资金。

       100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The risk level is Medium-High, as the return of a premier brand like 100 Thieves triggers intense speculative volatility and threatens the long-term scarcity premium of their legacy sticker sets.
       2. Recommendation: **HOLD** existing 100T legacy stickers to capitalize on the immediate "hype" rally, while selectively **BUYING** rain (FaZe) and GamerLegion player stickers before the roster transition is fully finalized.
       3. The strategic re-entry of 100 Thieves led by gla1ve will significantly boost brand-related liquidity, though the eventual influx of new 2026 sticker supply will likely cap the appreciation of older assets.

donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
Striker & Nohte
4-12-2025 05:02
"I changed the way I think," the Russian phenom says. "In previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge visible impact, [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone."


Spirit arrive at the Major after exiting five consecutive tournaments earlier than they would have liked, including a playoff miss at IEM Chengdu after losing to The MongolZ in their debut with Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal and a loss to Vitality in the quarter-final of BLAST Rivals Season 2.

Bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin for Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev was meant to be a firepower upgrade, but discomfort has been clear on the server and the team has needed to adapt coming into Budapest.

"In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players," Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets tells HLTV on the media day ahead of Stage 3. "These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves."

I became more vocal than I was
Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets on what has changed for him with this roster
It isn't just the team's system that has gone through changes, though, with donk saying he's become more vocal and speaking at length about a mentality shift within himself.

The 18-year-old also touched on the Player of the Year race, saying he is content with second place, but added that he believes he is in the kind of form that saw him clinch the award at the Perfect World Shanghai Major last year.


Watch the interview here, or listen here.

You're coming into the Major halfway through it, we've already seen a lot of Counter-Strike happen. Have you had a chance to watch much of it so far?

A little bit, yes. We were focused on practice, and I had to watch the late games, the games in the evening, and early in the day. Yes, a Major is always enjoyable to watch and exciting to see any matchups, except maybe Stage 1. A few matchups weren't really exciting or enjoyable to watch.

What did you think about the results so far? Has anything surprised you?

The only thing that was really surprising for me was that Legacy didn't qualify for Stage 3. It was really surprising. The other results, not really surprised. I could expect it.

These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves
Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
You're coming off of the back-to-back tournaments in Asia, where you didn't manage to go very far because of some close losses. What do you think went wrong in those two tournaments?

It's hard to notice one thing. In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players. These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves.

Does it mean some changes for them to feel more comfortable, or what does that look like in terms of getting them more confident?

It's more to integrate their place in our system and structure, and it makes them feel more confident and more comfortable. Because in previous teams, they had their own moves, some plays that they love where they could consistently get kills and get confidence after it, and in our system there is no space for it because we played with other players.

Are you trying to make this system more so that it allows these players to have their own expression and plays and things like that? Because obviously we know tN1R, especially, from his previous teams is a guy who likes to make a lot of moves and things like that. Is he hindered in that a little bit, is it harder for him to make those plays in your system?

In the beginning, for sure, yes. Now, it got easier for him to make some moves, and I think he feels good right now in our system because he knows what he can do and what he cannot.

It seems, at least from the outside, that he is doing a lot to bring the mood up. He seems like a very jokey guy, he's smiling a lot, and whenever I see some of your content he's always the one that's joking around. It seems like he's integrated very well in that sense. How important is that for you, personally?

I don't know. It's good, like... I don't know. I got used to playing with zont1x, who has no emotions, so I can't get affected by having emotions or not having emotions. I'm just okay with it. If he feels it makes him feel more comfortable in our team, I will support him in this way because I think such players that are always smiling and everything, they want to see the help, some support, so they can keep doing it.

I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone
Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
We haven't had a chance to talk to you since we saw tN1R arrive, so I just wanted to ask you about how this lineup affects you and how differently do you have to play to maybe allow them to have a bit more space. Does it mean that you maybe have to take a step back every now and again in certain situations because they have different ideas of how to play the game, or how does it affect you overall?

I can't say that it affects me somehow because I still have my roles and I'm still playing my roles. I'm entrying, I'm taking space, I'm the space creator, but I think I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact in terms of kills, entries, and impact in general. Visible impact, I would say. Kills, frags, average damage, everything like this.

These past tournaments made me think that I have to do everything to make my team shine, my teammates, and now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone — kill four, five, something like this. Not because my previous teammates like zont1x, magixx, were bad or something like this, I just became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player.

I want to do everything to make my teammates shine and that's it. But only one change in my playstyle that is different between the previous roster and this is that I became more vocal than I was. That's it.

Liquid matchup to start off the Major, one of the tougher opponents that you could face. What did you think of their run from 0-2 to 3-2? Does it make them a scarier opponent now?

Yes. I think for every team, it's not very enjoyable to play against a team that already played on the stage, or some official matches. They played three best-of-threes, two best-of-ones, and they are feeling good. All the pressure they were feeling now fell off, and now they're underdogs playing against favorites. It might be easier for them to perform now.

At the end of last year, you made a massive push in Shanghai to get the Player of the Year award at the end. Is this something that's on your mind at all coming into Budapest?

No. I'm good with number two player spot.

Do you think you're at least in the kind of form that could see you do the same thing again this year?

Like in Shanghai Major?

Yes.

I think yes.




ECSTATIC place entire roster on transfer list
MIRAA
4-12-2025 06:01
The future of Denmark's second-best team is uncertain as the off-season looms.


ECSTATIC will listen to offers for acoR, sirah & co
ECSTATIC have announced that their entire team has been placed on the transfer list as they want to give the players "the opportunity to move up competitively if the right offer comes in."

"We want to be transparent while making it clear that we're still fully committed to competing," the Danish organization noted.

"Everyone remains part of the team and will continue playing with us if no transfer happens."

ECSTATIC are currently ranked 31st in the European VRS, only behind Astralis in Denmark. The team recently won the $50,000 Winline Insight Season 9 and finished second to FUT at DraculaN Season 3, where they managed to beat AM, Tricked and Passion UA.

Last week, ECSTATIC went out of DreamHack Knockout Stockholm in the Round of 16 following a 2-1 loss to EYEBALLERS.

ECSTATIC won't participate in any more LANs until next year, but they are currently competing on two different online fronts: Galaxy Battle Phase 5, in which they will take on 500 in the Round of 16, and CCT Season 3 Series 12.

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
15:12:26 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:12:26 | INFO     | The market currently carries a high risk profile due to Team Spirit’s ongoing structural instability and the total roster dissolution of ECSTATIC, which signals a loss of brand momentum for mid-tier Danish assets. While donk remains a "blue-chip" individual asset, Spirit's recent string of early exits and system adjustments suggest high volatility heading into the Budapest Major. **Hold** donk-related stickers to speculate on his individual form, but **Sell** ECSTATIC items as the organization's exit from the competitive core indicates a terminal decline in market demand.

       Denmark Anton "⁠Anlelele⁠" Huynh
       Denmark Martin "⁠nut nut⁠" Holm Vestergaard
       Denmark William "⁠sirah⁠" Kjærsgaard

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a high risk profile due to Team Spirit’s ongoing structural instability and the total roster dissolution of ECSTATIC, which signals a loss of brand momentum for mid-tier Danish assets. While donk remains a "blue-chip" individual asset, Spirit's recent string of early exits and system adjustments suggest high volatility heading into the Budapest Major. **Hold** donk-related stickers to speculate on his individual form, but **Sell** ECSTATIC items as the organization's exit from the competitive core indicates a terminal decline in market demand.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, you should hold for a potential recovery unless you expect further depreciation, as a 3.45% decline is relatively minor.
15:12:53 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.02），价格处于此类印花的市场底价区间。虽然目前市场风险较高且波动剧烈，但 The MongolZ 作为亚洲赛区的领头羊，在 Major 赛事中依然具有潜在的表现预期。考虑到饰品交易平台普遍存在的手续费成本，此时平价卖出实际上会导致净亏损。在战队尚未出局且价格支撑强劲的情况下，持有是风险收益比更高的决策。

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       Striker & Nohte
       4-12-2025 05:02
       "I changed the way I think," the Russian phenom says. "In previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge visible impact, [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone."
       
       
       Spirit arrive at the Major after exiting five consecutive tournaments earlier than they would have liked, including a playoff miss at IEM Chengdu after losing to The MongolZ in their debut with Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal and a loss to Vitality in the quarter-final of BLAST Rivals Season 2.
       
       Bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin for Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev was meant to be a firepower upgrade, but discomfort has been clear on the server and the team has needed to adapt coming into Budapest.
       
       "In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players," Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets tells HLTV on the media day ahead of Stage 3. "These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves."
       
       I became more vocal than I was
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets on what has changed for him with this roster
       It isn't just the team's system that has gone through changes, though, with donk saying he's become more vocal and speaking at length about a mentality shift within himself.
       
       The 18-year-old also touched on the Player of the Year race, saying he is content with second place, but added that he believes he is in the kind of form that saw him clinch the award at the Perfect World Shanghai Major last year.
       
       
       Watch the interview here, or listen here.
       
       You're coming into the Major halfway through it, we've already seen a lot of Counter-Strike happen. Have you had a chance to watch much of it so far?
       
       A little bit, yes. We were focused on practice, and I had to watch the late games, the games in the evening, and early in the day. Yes, a Major is always enjoyable to watch and exciting to see any matchups, except maybe Stage 1. A few matchups weren't really exciting or enjoyable to watch.
       
       What did you think about the results so far? Has anything surprised you?
       
       The only thing that was really surprising for me was that Legacy didn't qualify for Stage 3. It was really surprising. The other results, not really surprised. I could expect it.
       
       These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       You're coming off of the back-to-back tournaments in Asia, where you didn't manage to go very far because of some close losses. What do you think went wrong in those two tournaments?
       
       It's hard to notice one thing. In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players. These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves.
       
       Does it mean some changes for them to feel more comfortable, or what does that look like in terms of getting them more confident?
       
       It's more to integrate their place in our system and structure, and it makes them feel more confident and more comfortable. Because in previous teams, they had their own moves, some plays that they love where they could consistently get kills and get confidence after it, and in our system there is no space for it because we played with other players.
       
       Are you trying to make this system more so that it allows these players to have their own expression and plays and things like that? Because obviously we know tN1R, especially, from his previous teams is a guy who likes to make a lot of moves and things like that. Is he hindered in that a little bit, is it harder for him to make those plays in your system?
       
       In the beginning, for sure, yes. Now, it got easier for him to make some moves, and I think he feels good right now in our system because he knows what he can do and what he cannot.
       
       It seems, at least from the outside, that he is doing a lot to bring the mood up. He seems like a very jokey guy, he's smiling a lot, and whenever I see some of your content he's always the one that's joking around. It seems like he's integrated very well in that sense. How important is that for you, personally?
       
       I don't know. It's good, like... I don't know. I got used to playing with zont1x, who has no emotions, so I can't get affected by having emotions or not having emotions. I'm just okay with it. If he feels it makes him feel more comfortable in our team, I will support him in this way because I think such players that are always smiling and everything, they want to see the help, some support, so they can keep doing it.
       
       I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       We haven't had a chance to talk to you since we saw tN1R arrive, so I just wanted to ask you about how this lineup affects you and how differently do you have to play to maybe allow them to have a bit more space. Does it mean that you maybe have to take a step back every now and again in certain situations because they have different ideas of how to play the game, or how does it affect you overall?
       
       I can't say that it affects me somehow because I still have my roles and I'm still playing my roles. I'm entrying, I'm taking space, I'm the space creator, but I think I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact in terms of kills, entries, and impact in general. Visible impact, I would say. Kills, frags, average damage, everything like this.
       
       These past tournaments made me think that I have to do everything to make my team shine, my teammates, and now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone — kill four, five, something like this. Not because my previous teammates like zont1x, magixx, were bad or something like this, I just became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player.
       
       I want to do everything to make my teammates shine and that's it. But only one change in my playstyle that is different between the previous roster and this is that I became more vocal than I was. That's it.
       
       Liquid matchup to start off the Major, one of the tougher opponents that you could face. What did you think of their run from 0-2 to 3-2? Does it make them a scarier opponent now?
       
       Yes. I think for every team, it's not very enjoyable to play against a team that already played on the stage, or some official matches. They played three best-of-threes, two best-of-ones, and they are feeling good. All the pressure they were feeling now fell off, and now they're underdogs playing against favorites. It might be easier for them to perform now.
       
       At the end of last year, you made a massive push in Shanghai to get the Player of the Year award at the end. Is this something that's on your mind at all coming into Budapest?
       
       No. I'm good with number two player spot.
       
       Do you think you're at least in the kind of form that could see you do the same thing again this year?
       
       Like in Shanghai Major?
       
       Yes.
       
       I think yes.
       
       
       
       
       ECSTATIC place entire roster on transfer list
       MIRAA
       4-12-2025 06:01
       The future of Denmark's second-best team is uncertain as the off-season looms.
       
       
       ECSTATIC will listen to offers for acoR, sirah & co
       ECSTATIC have announced that their entire team has been placed on the transfer list as they want to give the players "the opportunity to move up competitively if the right offer comes in."
       
       "We want to be transparent while making it clear that we're still fully committed to competing," the Danish organization noted.
       
       "Everyone remains part of the team and will continue playing with us if no transfer happens."
       
       ECSTATIC are currently ranked 31st in the European VRS, only behind Astralis in Denmark. The team recently won the $50,000 Winline Insight Season 9 and finished second to FUT at DraculaN Season 3, where they managed to beat AM, Tricked and Passion UA.
       
       Last week, ECSTATIC went out of DreamHack Knockout Stockholm in the Round of 16 following a 2-1 loss to EYEBALLERS.
       
       ECSTATIC won't participate in any more LANs until next year, but they are currently competing on two different online fronts: Galaxy Battle Phase 5, in which they will take on 500 in the Round of 16, and CCT Season 3 Series 12.

       With a 0.00% PnL, there is no profit to take or loss to cut, so you should hold the asset unless you have a better opportunity for your capital.
15:13:01 | INFO     |     -> Decision for HEROIC: HOLD, Reason: 虽然 HEROIC 目前面临 26.53% 的大幅亏损，但 Major 赛事正进入最关键的第三赛段（Stage 3），这是曝光度和市场关注度最高的阶段。财务分析报告虽然警告了市场的高风险性，但主要针对的是 ECSTATIC 这种解散的战队。HEROIC 作为参赛战队，其印花在接下来的比赛中仍有触底反弹的机会。此时卖出将锁定巨额亏损，建议持有观望其在第三赛段的表现，博取可能的补涨或减亏离场机会。

       It isn't just the team's system that has gone through changes, though, with donk saying he's become more vocal and speaking at length about a mentality shift within himself.
       
       The 18-year-old also touched on the Player of the Year race, saying he is content with second place, but added that he believes he is in the kind of form that saw him clinch the award at the Perfect World Shanghai Major last year.
       
       
       Watch the interview here, or listen here.
       
       You're coming into the Major halfway through it, we've already seen a lot of Counter-Strike happen. Have you had a chance to watch much of it so far?
       
       A little bit, yes. We were focused on practice, and I had to watch the late games, the games in the evening, and early in the day. Yes, a Major is always enjoyable to watch and exciting to see any matchups, except maybe Stage 1. A few matchups weren't really exciting or enjoyable to watch.
       
       What did you think about the results so far? Has anything surprised you?
       
       The only thing that was really surprising for me was that Legacy didn't qualify for Stage 3. It was really surprising. The other results, not really surprised. I could expect it.
       
       These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       You're coming off of the back-to-back tournaments in Asia, where you didn't manage to go very far because of some close losses. What do you think went wrong in those two tournaments?
       
       It's hard to notice one thing. In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players. These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves.
       
       Does it mean some changes for them to feel more comfortable, or what does that look like in terms of getting them more confident?
       
       It's more to integrate their place in our system and structure, and it makes them feel more confident and more comfortable. Because in previous teams, they had their own moves, some plays that they love where they could consistently get kills and get confidence after it, and in our system there is no space for it because we played with other players.
       
       Are you trying to make this system more so that it allows these players to have their own expression and plays and things like that? Because obviously we know tN1R, especially, from his previous teams is a guy who likes to make a lot of moves and things like that. Is he hindered in that a little bit, is it harder for him to make those plays in your system?
       
       In the beginning, for sure, yes. Now, it got easier for him to make some moves, and I think he feels good right now in our system because he knows what he can do and what he cannot.
       
       It seems, at least from the outside, that he is doing a lot to bring the mood up. He seems like a very jokey guy, he's smiling a lot, and whenever I see some of your content he's always the one that's joking around. It seems like he's integrated very well in that sense. How important is that for you, personally?
       
       I don't know. It's good, like... I don't know. I got used to playing with zont1x, who has no emotions, so I can't get affected by having emotions or not having emotions. I'm just okay with it. If he feels it makes him feel more comfortable in our team, I will support him in this way because I think such players that are always smiling and everything, they want to see the help, some support, so they can keep doing it.
       
       I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       We haven't had a chance to talk to you since we saw tN1R arrive, so I just wanted to ask you about how this lineup affects you and how differently do you have to play to maybe allow them to have a bit more space. Does it mean that you maybe have to take a step back every now and again in certain situations because they have different ideas of how to play the game, or how does it affect you overall?
       
       I can't say that it affects me somehow because I still have my roles and I'm still playing my roles. I'm entrying, I'm taking space, I'm the space creator, but I think I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact in terms of kills, entries, and impact in general. Visible impact, I would say. Kills, frags, average damage, everything like this.
       
       These past tournaments made me think that I have to do everything to make my team shine, my teammates, and now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone — kill four, five, something like this. Not because my previous teammates like zont1x, magixx, were bad or something like this, I just became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player.
       
       I want to do everything to make my teammates shine and that's it. But only one change in my playstyle that is different between the previous roster and this is that I became more vocal than I was. That's it.
       
       Liquid matchup to start off the Major, one of the tougher opponents that you could face. What did you think of their run from 0-2 to 3-2? Does it make them a scarier opponent now?
       
       Yes. I think for every team, it's not very enjoyable to play against a team that already played on the stage, or some official matches. They played three best-of-threes, two best-of-ones, and they are feeling good. All the pressure they were feeling now fell off, and now they're underdogs playing against favorites. It might be easier for them to perform now.
       
       At the end of last year, you made a massive push in Shanghai to get the Player of the Year award at the end. Is this something that's on your mind at all coming into Budapest?
       
       No. I'm good with number two player spot.
       
       Do you think you're at least in the kind of form that could see you do the same thing again this year?
       
       Like in Shanghai Major?
       
       Yes.
       
       I think yes.
       
       
       
       
       ECSTATIC place entire roster on transfer list
       MIRAA
       4-12-2025 06:01
       The future of Denmark's second-best team is uncertain as the off-season looms.
       
       
       ECSTATIC will listen to offers for acoR, sirah & co
       ECSTATIC have announced that their entire team has been placed on the transfer list as they want to give the players "the opportunity to move up competitively if the right offer comes in."
       
       "We want to be transparent while making it clear that we're still fully committed to competing," the Danish organization noted.
       
       "Everyone remains part of the team and will continue playing with us if no transfer happens."
       
       ECSTATIC are currently ranked 31st in the European VRS, only behind Astralis in Denmark. The team recently won the $50,000 Winline Insight Season 9 and finished second to FUT at DraculaN Season 3, where they managed to beat AM, Tricked and Passion UA.
       
       Last week, ECSTATIC went out of DreamHack Knockout Stockholm in the Round of 16 following a 2-1 loss to EYEBALLERS.
       
       ECSTATIC won't participate in any more LANs until next year, but they are currently competing on two different online fronts: Galaxy Battle Phase 5, in which they will take on 500 in the Round of 16, and CCT Season 3 Series 12.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a high risk profile due to Team Spirit’s ongoing structural instability and the total roster dissolution of ECSTATIC, which signals a loss of brand momentum for mid-tier Danish assets. While donk remains a "blue-chip" individual asset, Spirit's recent string of early exits and system adjustments suggest high volatility heading into the Budapest Major. **Hold** donk-related stickers to speculate on his individual form, but **Sell** ECSTATIC items as the organization's exit from the competitive core indicates a terminal decline in market demand.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a minor 2% loss, there is no profit to take, and you should only cut loss if the price falls below your predetermined risk threshold.

       "I changed the way I think," the Russian phenom says. "In previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge visible impact, [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone."
       
       
       Spirit arrive at the Major after exiting five consecutive tournaments earlier than they would have liked, including a playoff miss at IEM Chengdu after losing to The MongolZ in their debut with Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal and a loss to Vitality in the quarter-final of BLAST Rivals Season 2.
       
       Bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin for Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev was meant to be a firepower upgrade, but discomfort has been clear on the server and the team has needed to adapt coming into Budapest.

       I don't know. It's good, like... I don't know. I got used to playing with zont1x, who has no emotions, so I can't get affected by having emotions or not having emotions. I'm just okay with it. If he feels it makes him feel more comfortable in our team, I will support him in this way because I think such players that are always smiling and everything, they want to see the help, some support, so they can keep doing it.
       
       I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       We haven't had a chance to talk to you since we saw tN1R arrive, so I just wanted to ask you about how this lineup affects you and how differently do you have to play to maybe allow them to have a bit more space. Does it mean that you maybe have to take a step back every now and again in certain situations because they have different ideas of how to play the game, or how does it affect you overall?
       
       I can't say that it affects me somehow because I still have my roles and I'm still playing my roles. I'm entrying, I'm taking space, I'm the space creator, but I think I changed the way I think. It will sound egotistical, but in previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge impact in terms of kills, entries, and impact in general. Visible impact, I would say. Kills, frags, average damage, everything like this.
       
       These past tournaments made me think that I have to do everything to make my team shine, my teammates, and now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone — kill four, five, something like this. Not because my previous teammates like zont1x, magixx, were bad or something like this, I just became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player.
       
       I want to do everything to make my teammates shine and that's it. But only one change in my playstyle that is different between the previous roster and this is that I became more vocal than I was. That's it.
       
       Liquid matchup to start off the Major, one of the tougher opponents that you could face. What did you think of their run from 0-2 to 3-2? Does it make them a scarier opponent now?
       
       Yes. I think for every team, it's not very enjoyable to play against a team that already played on the stage, or some official matches. They played three best-of-threes, two best-of-ones, and they are feeling good. All the pressure they were feeling now fell off, and now they're underdogs playing against favorites. It might be easier for them to perform now.
       
       At the end of last year, you made a massive push in Shanghai to get the Player of the Year award at the end. Is this something that's on your mind at all coming into Budapest?
       
       No. I'm good with number two player spot.
       
       Do you think you're at least in the kind of form that could see you do the same thing again this year?
       
       Like in Shanghai Major?
       
       Yes.
       
       I think yes.
       
       
       
       
       ECSTATIC place entire roster on transfer list
       MIRAA
       4-12-2025 06:01
       The future of Denmark's second-best team is uncertain as the off-season looms.
       
       
       ECSTATIC will listen to offers for acoR, sirah & co
       ECSTATIC have announced that their entire team has been placed on the transfer list as they want to give the players "the opportunity to move up competitively if the right offer comes in."
       
       "We want to be transparent while making it clear that we're still fully committed to competing," the Danish organization noted.
       
       "Everyone remains part of the team and will continue playing with us if no transfer happens."
       
       ECSTATIC are currently ranked 31st in the European VRS, only behind Astralis in Denmark. The team recently won the $50,000 Winline Insight Season 9 and finished second to FUT at DraculaN Season 3, where they managed to beat AM, Tricked and Passion UA.
       
       Last week, ECSTATIC went out of DreamHack Knockout Stockholm in the Round of 16 following a 2-1 loss to EYEBALLERS.
       
       ECSTATIC won't participate in any more LANs until next year, but they are currently competing on two different online fronts: Galaxy Battle Phase 5, in which they will take on 500 in the Round of 16, and CCT Season 3 Series 12.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a high risk profile due to Team Spirit’s ongoing structural instability and the total roster dissolution of ECSTATIC, which signals a loss of brand momentum for mid-tier Danish assets. While donk remains a "blue-chip" individual asset, Spirit's recent string of early exits and system adjustments suggest high volatility heading into the Budapest Major. **Hold** donk-related stickers to speculate on his individual form, but **Sell** ECSTATIC items as the organization's exit from the competitive core indicates a terminal decline in market demand.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at an 18.87% loss, taking profit is not an option, and you should consider cutting your loss to preserve capital unless you have a strong reason to believe in a price reversal.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       Striker & Nohte
       4-12-2025 05:02
       "I changed the way I think," the Russian phenom says. "In previous times I was always thinking about getting kills and doing huge visible impact, [...] now I have the mentality that I don't really need to kill someone."
       
       
       Spirit arrive at the Major after exiting five consecutive tournaments earlier than they would have liked, including a playoff miss at IEM Chengdu after losing to The MongolZ in their debut with Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal and a loss to Vitality in the quarter-final of BLAST Rivals Season 2.
       
       Bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin for Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev was meant to be a firepower upgrade, but discomfort has been clear on the server and the team has needed to adapt coming into Budapest.
       
       "In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players," Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets tells HLTV on the media day ahead of Stage 3. "These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves."
       
       I became more vocal than I was
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets on what has changed for him with this roster
       It isn't just the team's system that has gone through changes, though, with donk saying he's become more vocal and speaking at length about a mentality shift within himself.
       
       The 18-year-old also touched on the Player of the Year race, saying he is content with second place, but added that he believes he is in the kind of form that saw him clinch the award at the Perfect World Shanghai Major last year.
       
       
       Watch the interview here, or listen here.
       
       You're coming into the Major halfway through it, we've already seen a lot of Counter-Strike happen. Have you had a chance to watch much of it so far?
       
       A little bit, yes. We were focused on practice, and I had to watch the late games, the games in the evening, and early in the day. Yes, a Major is always enjoyable to watch and exciting to see any matchups, except maybe Stage 1. A few matchups weren't really exciting or enjoyable to watch.
       
       What did you think about the results so far? Has anything surprised you?
       
       The only thing that was really surprising for me was that Legacy didn't qualify for Stage 3. It was really surprising. The other results, not really surprised. I could expect it.
       
       These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves
       Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       You're coming off of the back-to-back tournaments in Asia, where you didn't manage to go very far because of some close losses. What do you think went wrong in those two tournaments?
       
       It's hard to notice one thing. In general, I can say that our system works another way with these players, with new players, and that we need to adapt the system for new players. These few tournaments we were focused on the goal to make our system comfortable and make our players confident in our system and themselves.
       
       Does it mean some changes for them to feel more comfortable, or what does that look like in terms of getting them more confident?
       
       It's more to integrate their place in our system and structure, and it makes them feel more confident and more comfortable. Because in previous teams, they had their own moves, some plays that they love where they could consistently get kills and get confidence after it, and in our system there is no space for it because we played with other players.
       
       Are you trying to make this system more so that it allows these players to have their own expression and plays and things like that? Because obviously we know tN1R, especially, from his previous teams is a guy who likes to make a lot of moves and things like that. Is he hindered in that a little bit, is it harder for him to make those plays in your system?
       
       In the beginning, for sure, yes. Now, it got easier for him to make some moves, and I think he feels good right now in our system because he knows what he can do and what he cannot.
       
       It seems, at least from the outside, that he is doing a lot to bring the mood up. He seems like a very jokey guy, he's smiling a lot, and whenever I see some of your content he's always the one that's joking around. It seems like he's integrated very well in that sense. How important is that for you, personally?

       Yes.
       
       I think yes.
       
       
       
       
       ECSTATIC place entire roster on transfer list
       MIRAA
       4-12-2025 06:01
       The future of Denmark's second-best team is uncertain as the off-season looms.
       
       
       ECSTATIC will listen to offers for acoR, sirah & co
       ECSTATIC have announced that their entire team has been placed on the transfer list as they want to give the players "the opportunity to move up competitively if the right offer comes in."
       
       "We want to be transparent while making it clear that we're still fully committed to competing," the Danish organization noted.
       
       "Everyone remains part of the team and will continue playing with us if no transfer happens."
       
       ECSTATIC are currently ranked 31st in the European VRS, only behind Astralis in Denmark. The team recently won the $50,000 Winline Insight Season 9 and finished second to FUT at DraculaN Season 3, where they managed to beat AM, Tricked and Passion UA.
       
       Last week, ECSTATIC went out of DreamHack Knockout Stockholm in the Round of 16 following a 2-1 loss to EYEBALLERS.
       
       ECSTATIC won't participate in any more LANs until next year, but they are currently competing on two different online fronts: Galaxy Battle Phase 5, in which they will take on 500 in the Round of 16, and CCT Season 3 Series 12.

       The Danish team looks as follows:

       Denmark Anton "⁠Anlelele⁠" Huynh
       Denmark Martin "⁠nut nut⁠" Holm Vestergaard
       Denmark William "⁠sirah⁠" Kjærsgaard
       Denmark Frederik "⁠acoR⁠" Gyldstrand
       
       
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a high risk profile due to Team Spirit’s ongoing structural instability and the total roster dissolution of ECSTATIC, which signals a loss of brand momentum for mid-tier Danish assets. While donk remains a "blue-chip" individual asset, Spirit's recent string of early exits and system adjustments suggest high volatility heading into the Budapest Major. **Hold** donk-related stickers to speculate on his individual form, but **Sell** ECSTATIC items as the organization's exit from the competitive core indicates a terminal decline in market demand.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as the 0.12% gain is negligible and would likely result in a net loss after transaction fees.

Rumors point to Inner Circle's cairne as a possible substitute.


Michel "⁠ewjerkz⁠" Pinto is nearing the end of his time as a starter in Ninjas in Pyjamas according to a report from RTP Arena, which HLTV has backed with its own sources.

The news comes after Ninjas in Pyjamas's run to the StarLadder Budapest Major, where not only did the Marco "⁠Snappi⁠" Pfeiffer-led squad qualify for the Valve-backed event, but made it to the Stage 2 and even went 2-0 before losing three straight best-of-threes in the second Swiss group.

The Portuguese player has been in Ninjas in Pyjamas's books since the beginning of the year and was instrumental in the European team's climb through the VRS system to reach the aforementioned Major, posting a 1.08 rating during his time as a Ninja.

Other than first and second places at Fragadelphia events in the hunt for VRS points, ewjerkz contributed to reaching the quarter-finals at PGL Astana and a run to the final at StarLadder StarSeries Fall 2025 among his best finishes with Ninjas in Pyjamas.

RTP Arena cites rumors of Artem "⁠cairne⁠" Mushynskyi being the player who could substitute ewjerkz in Ninjas in Pyjamas's starting five in 2026. The Ukrainian 23-year-old has had a breakout year with Inner Circle, posting a 1.20 rating in the Ukrainian team's rise from obscurity and shining alongside 18-year-old prospect David "⁠Dawy⁠" Bibik.

This move will put an end to Portuguese representation in Ninjas in Pyjamas for now, which started at the beginning of the year when ewjerkz and countryman Rafael "⁠arrozdoce⁠" Wing joined the team after breaking out on the international scene with SAW in 2023 and 2024.

15:14:36 | INFO     | The risk level for ewjerkz-branded assets is high, as the news of his departure from NIP creates a speculative "legacy" bubble that is typically followed by a sharp price correction and reduced long-term demand. I recommend a **Sell** on ewjerkz Budapest 2025 stickers to capitalize on the immediate news-driven price spike before market liquidity diminishes. However, investors should **Hold** NIP team stickers, as the pivot toward a high-rated prospect like cairne suggests the organization remains a strong contender for maintaining its Tier-1 VRS standing in 2026.

       Michel "⁠ewjerkz⁠" Pinto is nearing the end of his time as a starter in Ninjas in Pyjamas according to a report from RTP Arena, which HLTV has backed with its own sources.
       
       The news comes after Ninjas in Pyjamas's run to the StarLadder Budapest Major, where not only did the Marco "⁠Snappi⁠" Pfeiffer-led squad qualify for the Valve-backed event, but made it to the Stage 2 and even went 2-0 before losing three straight best-of-threes in the second Swiss group.
       
       The Portuguese player has been in Ninjas in Pyjamas's books since the beginning of the year and was instrumental in the European team's climb through the VRS system to reach the aforementioned Major, posting a 1.08 rating during his time as a Ninja.
       
       Other than first and second places at Fragadelphia events in the hunt for VRS points, ewjerkz contributed to reaching the quarter-finals at PGL Astana and a run to the final at StarLadder StarSeries Fall 2025 among his best finishes with Ninjas in Pyjamas.
       
       RTP Arena cites rumors of Artem "⁠cairne⁠" Mushynskyi being the player who could substitute ewjerkz in Ninjas in Pyjamas's starting five in 2026. The Ukrainian 23-year-old has had a breakout year with Inner Circle, posting a 1.20 rating in the Ukrainian team's rise from obscurity and shining alongside 18-year-old prospect David "⁠Dawy⁠" Bibik.
       
       This move will put an end to Portuguese representation in Ninjas in Pyjamas for now, which started at the beginning of the year when ewjerkz and countryman Rafael "⁠arrozdoce⁠" Wing joined the team after breaking out on the international scene with SAW in 2023 and 2024.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The risk level for ewjerkz-branded assets is high, as the news of his departure from NIP creates a speculative "legacy" bubble that is typically followed by a sharp price correction and reduced long-term demand. I recommend a **Sell** on ewjerkz Budapest 2025 stickers to capitalize on the immediate news-driven price spike before market liquidity diminishes. However, investors should **Hold** NIP team stickers, as the pivot toward a high-rated prospect like cairne suggests the organization remains a strong contender for maintaining its Tier-1 VRS standing in 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at a loss, you cannot take profit and should consider cutting your loss if the price drops below your predetermined risk threshold.
15:15:52 | INFO     |     -> Decision for ZywOo: HOLD, Reason: ZywOo 作为顶级“蓝筹”个人资产，目前仅有 0.48% 的极小浮亏，基本处于持平状态。今日情绪评分高达 93/100，反映出市场对 ZywOo 在 Major 淘汰赛阶段的表现极度看好。虽然今日新闻焦点在于 NIP 的人员变动，但 ZywOo 作为顶级明星选手，其印花价值具有极强的抗风险能力和上涨潜力。考虑到交易手续费成本，此时卖出并不明智。建议继续持有，捕捉 Major 后续赛段带来的价格爆发。

The Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek-led side had traversed Stage 2 by the skin of their teeth, but the Stage 3 opposition proved too difficult to handle on day one as Liquid immediately dropped to the elimination zone after best-of-one losses to The MongolZ and Spirit.

T sides were the source of their woes on the opening day and the trend continued in the series against Passion UA.

Liquid got off to a 9-3 start on Train but couldn't convert the lead once sides switched, giving out on their offense as Passion UA kept them at bay with a dynamic CT side.

Johnny "⁠JT⁠" Theodosiou seemingly read Liquid like an open book with aggressive moves and spot-on rotations wherever they went, securing the opener 13-11 despite the slow start.

Mirage was just more of the same with Liquid struggling to make their opening moves work across the map, with Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol and JT leading the way to another 10-2 CT half.


Closing out the match from there turned out a more difficult prospect than anticipated as Liquid got within one round after a flawless start to their defense.

In the end, Passion UA finally broke through with an A split in round 20 and went on to punish a double-AWP setup in the following round, sending Liquid packing two rounds later.

15:16:03 | INFO     | Liquid’s catastrophic 0-3 exit from the Budapest Major triggers an immediate "disappointment dip," as speculative investors panic-sell stickers following the team's failure to reach the high-visibility playoff stages.

       With a -4.03% return, taking profit is impossible, and you should only cut loss if you believe the price will continue to decline.
15:16:32 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 今日情绪评分大幅升至 82/100，主要是因为他们在 Major 第三赛段中击败了强敌 Liquid。虽然 Liquid 的 0-3 出局引发了市场的恐慌性抛售，但 The MongolZ 作为胜利方，其印花的关注度和潜在价值正在提升。目前价格处于盈亏平衡点（0.02），即此类印花的市场底价，卖出将因手续费导致净亏损。鉴于战队在 Major 中的强劲表现和极高情绪评分，持有是博取后续反弹的最佳选择。

       Liquid’s catastrophic 0-3 exit from the Budapest Major triggers an immediate "disappointment dip," as speculative investors panic-sell stickers following the team's failure to reach the high-visibility playoff stages. The risk level is currently **High** due to short-term downward volatility and the high probability of roster-change rumors further destabilizing prices. My recommendation is to **Hold** existing positions to avoid selling at the bottom of the panic, or selectively **Buy** the crash if prices hit a 15-20% retracement, as Liquid remains a premium "legacy" brand with long-term recovery potential.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as selling at break-even would likely result in a net loss once transaction fees are applied.
15:16:41 | INFO     |     -> Decision for HEROIC: HOLD, Reason: 虽然 HEROIC 目前面临 23.47% 的大幅亏损，但财务分析报告指出，Liquid 的 0-3 出局引发了市场的恐慌性抛售（disappointment dip）。在这种高风险、高波动的环境下，分析师明确建议“持有”现有头寸，以避免在恐慌情绪的最底部卖出。HEROIC 仍处于 Major 赛事中，随着恐慌情绪平复和赛事进程推进，印花价格仍有反弹或修复的空间。此时割肉将锁定巨额亏损，建议耐心持有，等待市场情绪回暖。

15:16:52 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: HOLD, Reason: Spirit 目前处于盈亏平衡点（25.0），且今日情绪评分高达 90/100。虽然 Liquid 的出局引发了市场整体的恐慌性抛售（disappointment dip），但 Spirit 在 Major 第三赛段中击败了 Liquid，表现极其稳健。财务分析报告建议在此类高风险波动期持有头寸以避免在底部被震出。作为夺冠热门，Spirit 的曝光度和市场需求预计将持续走高，目前没有任何止损或减仓的理由。建议继续持有，捕捉后续赛段的上涨红利。

15:17:09 | INFO     |     -> Decision for ZywOo: HOLD, Reason: ZywOo 目前仅有 0.48% 的极小浮亏，且情绪评分高达 91/100。虽然 Liquid 的出局导致了市场整体的短期恐慌，但 ZywOo 作为顶级明星选手及 Vitality 的核心，其个人资产的抗风险能力极强。财务分析报告建议在此类波动期持有头寸以避免在恐慌底部卖出。考虑到 Vitality 在接下来的淘汰赛阶段具有极高的关注度和表现预期，持有是捕捉潜在上涨红利的最优策略。

       Liquid go 0-3 after collapse versus Passion UA
       Striker
       6-12-2025 01:53
       From up 9-3 on Train, Liquid went 4-20 in consecutive T halves to crash out of Stage 3.
       
       
       Liquid have been eliminated from the StarLadder Budapest Major after Passion UA dealt them their third consecutive loss in Stage 3.

       The Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek-led side had traversed Stage 2 by the skin of their teeth, but the Stage 3 opposition proved too difficult to handle on day one as Liquid immediately dropped to the elimination zone after best-of-one losses to The MongolZ and Spirit.
       
       T sides were the source of their woes on the opening day and the trend continued in the series against Passion UA.
       
       Liquid got off to a 9-3 start on Train but couldn't convert the lead once sides switched, giving out on their offense as Passion UA kept them at bay with a dynamic CT side.
       
       Johnny "⁠JT⁠" Theodosiou seemingly read Liquid like an open book with aggressive moves and spot-on rotations wherever they went, securing the opener 13-11 despite the slow start.
       
       Mirage was just more of the same with Liquid struggling to make their opening moves work across the map, with Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol and JT leading the way to another 10-2 CT half.
       
       
       Closing out the match from there turned out a more difficult prospect than anticipated as Liquid got within one round after a flawless start to their defense.
       
       In the end, Passion UA finally broke through with an A split in round 20 and went on to punish a double-AWP setup in the following round, sending Liquid packing two rounds later.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       Liquid’s catastrophic 0-3 exit from the Budapest Major triggers an immediate "disappointment dip," as speculative investors panic-sell stickers following the team's failure to reach the high-visibility playoff stages. The risk level is currently **High** due to short-term downward volatility and the high probability of roster-change rumors further destabilizing prices. My recommendation is to **Hold** existing positions to avoid selling at the bottom of the panic, or selectively **Buy** the crash if prices hit a 15-20% retracement, as Liquid remains a premium "legacy" brand with long-term recovery potential.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a negligible loss of 0.48%, it is best to hold, as there is currently no profit to take and the dip is too minor to justify cutting your loss.

15:17:22 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:17:22 | INFO     | The market currently carries a moderate-to-high risk profile as price volatility peaks during the ongoing StarLadder Budapest Major, with "Day 8" updates suggesting we are entering the high-stakes playoff phase. While the leak of a 2026 Singapore Major provides a positive long-term outlook for Asian market expansion, the immediate financial climate is dominated by speculative fluctuations surrounding active tournament stickers and potential post-event supply saturation. My recommendation is to **HOLD** top-tier team stickers like NAVI and Spirit to ride the current momentum, while looking to **SELL** individual player stickers that have hit peak hype before the tournament concludes.

15:17:32 | INFO     | 
>>> [STEP 4] SELL DECISIONS
15:17:43 | INFO     |     -> Decision for 100 Thieves: HOLD, Reason: 100 Thieves 属于绝版（Legacy）高价值饰品，其价格受当前 Major 赛事即时结果的直接影响较小。虽然目前账面亏损 4.03%，但 70/100 的情绪评分显示市场对该品牌重返 CS 赛场的利好预期依然存在。财务分析报告建议持有顶级战队头寸（如 Spirit、NAVI），而 100 Thieves 作为一个具有极高品牌价值和稀缺性的标的，在 Major 带来的整体市场热度下具备较强的抗跌性。考虑到目前卖出将锁定亏损，建议继续持有，等待品牌效应进一步发酵或市场整体回暖。

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, you should hold for a potential recovery or cut your loss now to prevent further downside, as taking profit is not an option.
15:17:55 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.02），且情绪评分高达 80/100。随着 Major 进入高风险的淘汰赛阶段，The MongolZ 作为亚洲赛区的核心战队，其关注度和市场热度正在稳步提升。此外，2026 年新加坡 Major 的泄露消息对整个亚洲电竞市场是长期的利好信号。考虑到交易手续费成本，此时卖出将导致净亏损。鉴于战队在 Major 中的强劲势头和极高情绪评分，持有是博取后续反弹的最优选择。

       The Czech sniper averaged a 1.12 rating in 2025 despite ECLOT making several haphazard changes to its roster, moves which the organization apologized for and called a "clown fiesta" in August. He is set to become a free agent on December 31.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a moderate-to-high risk profile as price volatility peaks during the ongoing StarLadder Budapest Major, with "Day 8" updates suggesting we are entering the high-stakes playoff phase. While the leak of a 2026 Singapore Major provides a positive long-term outlook for Asian market expansion, the immediate financial climate is dominated by speculative fluctuations surrounding active tournament stickers and potential post-event supply saturation. My recommendation is to **HOLD** top-tier team stickers like NAVI and Spirit to ride the current momentum, while looking to **SELL** individual player stickers that have hit peak hype before the tournament concludes.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are at break-even, hold the asset as there is no profit to take and selling now would likely result in a net loss due to transaction fees.
15:18:04 | INFO     |     -> Decision for HEROIC: HOLD, Reason: 虽然 HEROIC 目前面临 24.49% 的大幅亏损，但财务分析报告指出，Major 赛事正进入高风险、高波动的淘汰赛阶段。在这种环境下，分析师建议持有顶级战队头寸以顺应当前的市场动量。HEROIC 仍处于 Major 赛事中，随着赛事进程推进到淘汰赛，其曝光度和话题性仍有回升空间。此时卖出将锁定巨额亏损，建议继续持有，观察其在淘汰赛阶段的表现，博取可能的补涨或减亏离场机会。

       Short: Leaks hint at Singapore for second 2026 Major
       Leaked code from the PGL website suggests that Singapore may serve as the location for the second Major of 2026. If true, this would mark the second time the Major has been held in Asia, two years after the Perfect World Shanghai Major in winter 2024.

       With a 24.49% loss, taking profit is not an option, so you should consider cutting your losses to preserve your remaining capital unless you have a strong reason to believe the price will recover.
15:18:13 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: HOLD, Reason: Spirit 目前处于盈亏平衡点（25.0），且情绪评分高达 88/100。财务分析报告明确建议持有 Spirit 等顶级战队印花，以顺应当前的赛事动量并博取淘汰赛阶段的溢价。作为 Major 的核心夺冠战队，Spirit 的曝光度和市场需求预计将持续走高。目前没有任何止损或减仓的理由，继续持有是捕捉后续赛段上涨红利的最优策略。

       Since you are at break-even with 0.00% PnL, there is currently no profit to take or loss to cut, making it a neutral time to either hold for future growth or exit if your original investment thesis has changed.
15:18:24 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Vitality: HOLD, Reason: Vitality 目前面临 7.39% 的浮亏，但情绪评分依然高达 85/100。财务分析报告虽然警告了市场的高风险性，但明确建议持有顶级战队（如 Spirit、NAVI）头寸，而 Vitality 同样属于此类顶级蓝筹战队。随着 Major 进入淘汰赛阶段，Vitality 的曝光度和市场需求预计将持续走高。此时割肉将锁定亏损，建议遵循分析报告建议，继续持有等待赛事后期带来的价格修复机会。

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a moderate-to-high risk profile as price volatility peaks during the ongoing StarLadder Budapest Major, with "Day 8" updates suggesting we are entering the high-stakes playoff phase. While the leak of a 2026 Singapore Major provides a positive long-term outlook for Asian market expansion, the immediate financial climate is dominated by speculative fluctuations surrounding active tournament stickers and potential post-event supply saturation. My recommendation is to **HOLD** top-tier team stickers like NAVI and Spirit to ride the current momentum, while looking to **SELL** individual player stickers that have hit peak hype before the tournament concludes.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as a 2.29% decrease is minor market volatility and does not yet justify cutting a loss on a high-tier player item.

Matchups set for Budapest Major playoffs
NER0cs
8-12-2025 06:26
NiKo will face donk for the fourth time in 2025.


Spirit will face Falcons in the marquee matchup of the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs, as an in-form Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets looks to overcome Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač for the first time in 2025.

The only team to not return to playoffs after making top-eight in Austin is paiN, with Falcons replacing them in what is already the Saudi organization's best result at a Valve-sponsored event.

That makes it a stacked bracket consisting of eight top-10 teams, as of the live VRS, ready to fight for Counter-Strike's most prestigous title.

The top half of the bracket will also see a rematch of the Austin Major grand final as Vitality take on The MongolZ.

Then, hometown hero Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás's MOUZ side will take on Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's FaZe Clan to kick off Friday.

Finally, world number one FURIA face Natus Vincere as Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo bids to win his first Major since 2016.

PGL announce Singapore Major in 2026
LucasAM
8-12-2025 11:18
The event will serve as the second Major of the year, running between November and December.


PGL has announced that it will host the second Major of 2026 in Singapore on November 25-December 13 featuring a $1,250,000 prize pool.

The Major will have 32 teams playing through three stages before moving to the 12,000 capacity Singapore Indoor Stadium for the playoffs, where the tournament will conclude with a best-of-five grand final to crown the champion.

After the Perfect World Shanghai Major broke the barrier for the whole of Asia to get Counter-Strike's most prestigious event in 2024, PGL will now bring a Major to Southeast Asia for the first time.

The event in Singapore will mark PGL's fifth time hosting a Major after PGL Krakow 2017, PGL Stockholm 2021, PGL Antwerp 2022, and PGL Copenhagen 2024. PGL has also hosted several DOTA 2 events in Singapore, including The International in 2022.

"Singapore has been host to exciting esports events such as The International, the largest DOTA 2 esports event in the world, and we look forward with much anticipation to hosting our first Counter Strike Major in 2026, which will reinforce Singapore as a world-class events destination," says Ms. Jean Ng, an Assistant Chief Executive from the Singapore Tourism Board.

"As one of the most prestigious tournaments in the Counter-Strike scene, the event promises to attract fans from around the region, and we invite them to also enjoy Singapore’s lifestyle experiences and vibrant energy."




Falcons top ESL's final Annual Club Incentive 2025 standings

8-12-2025 19:38
The Saudi organization had the best viewership figures across ESL's events and will thus receive just over $400,000.


ESL have released the final standings of their Annual Club Incentive program for 2025 after the conclusion of IEM Chengdu, with its $2,950,000 prizepool set to be paid out in the first quarter of 2026.

The Annual Club Incentive program is a non-exclusive system designed to reward teams for their contribution to the ESL Pro Tour "in the form of tournament attendance, viewership as well as promotional activities related to ESL events," and is now set to pay out the top 16 teams ranked by their average concurrent viewers in the group stages.

Falcons have topped the standings and will therefore take home $407,422, just ahead of The MongolZ, who rose from fourth to second after IEM Chengdu and will now pocket $295,313, while FURIA, Natus Vincere, and Vitality round out the top five.

The program will come back for a second installment in 2026, with the first event of the year being IEM Krakow, set to being on January 28.

The top five in the Annual Club Incentive standings and their prize money are:

Europe Falcons - $407,422

Mongolia The MongolZ - $295,313

Brazil FURIA - $281,250

Europe Natus Vincere - $278,906

Europe Vitality - $262,500

       "Singapore has been host to exciting esports events such as The International, the largest DOTA 2 esports event in the world, and we look forward with much anticipation to hosting our first Counter Strike Major in 2026, which will reinforce Singapore as a world-class events destination," says Ms. Jean Ng, an Assistant Chief Executive from the Singapore Tourism Board.
       
       "As one of the most prestigious tournaments in the Counter-Strike scene, the event promises to attract fans from around the region, and we invite them to also enjoy Singapore’s lifestyle experiences and vibrant energy."
       
       
       
       
       Falcons top ESL's final Annual Club Incentive 2025 standings

       8-12-2025 19:38
       The Saudi organization had the best viewership figures across ESL's events and will thus receive just over $400,000.
       
       
       ESL have released the final standings of their Annual Club Incentive program for 2025 after the conclusion of IEM Chengdu, with its $2,950,000 prizepool set to be paid out in the first quarter of 2026.
       
       The Annual Club Incentive program is a non-exclusive system designed to reward teams for their contribution to the ESL Pro Tour "in the form of tournament attendance, viewership as well as promotional activities related to ESL events," and is now set to pay out the top 16 teams ranked by their average concurrent viewers in the group stages.
       
       Falcons have topped the standings and will therefore take home $407,422, just ahead of The MongolZ, who rose from fourth to second after IEM Chengdu and will now pocket $295,313, while FURIA, Natus Vincere, and Vitality round out the top five.
       
       The program will come back for a second installment in 2026, with the first event of the year being IEM Krakow, set to being on January 28.
       
       The top five in the Annual Club Incentive standings and their prize money are:
       
       Europe Falcons - $407,422
       
       Mongolia The MongolZ - $295,313
       
       Brazil FURIA - $281,250
       
       Europe Natus Vincere - $278,906

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently carries a moderate-to-high risk profile as it enters the volatile Budapest Major playoff phase, though long-term sentiment is bolstered by the confirmed 2026 Major cycle in Singapore. Surging viewership and performance data for organizations like Falcons and The MongolZ indicate peak brand liquidity and potential for short-term price spikes during the bracket stages. 
       
       **Recommendation: HOLD** current playoff-bound stickers to capitalize on immediate hype, but prepare to **SELL** immediately following the Grand Final to avoid the inevitable post-Major price correction and supply saturation.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as there is no profit to take and selling at the minimum price floor often results in a net loss after transaction fees.
15:19:29 | INFO     |     -> Decision for HEROIC: SELL, Reason: HEROIC 目前未能晋级布达佩斯 Major 淘汰赛（Playoffs），其印花在接下来的赛事高潮期将面临严重的关注度流失和流动性枯竭。今日情绪评分仅为 45/100，反映出市场对其后续价值的悲观预期。根据财务分析报告，资金正显著流向 Spirit、Falcons、The MongolZ 等进入淘汰赛的强队。与其持有处于‘阴跌’通道且缺乏赛事红利的资产，不如及时止损（-8.16%），将资金调仓至具备更强动量和更高收视热度的淘汰赛参与战队印花。

       NiKo will face donk for the fourth time in 2025.
       
       
       Spirit will face Falcons in the marquee matchup of the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs, as an in-form Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets looks to overcome Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač for the first time in 2025.
       
       The only team to not return to playoffs after making top-eight in Austin is paiN, with Falcons replacing them in what is already the Saudi organization's best result at a Valve-sponsored event.
       
       That makes it a stacked bracket consisting of eight top-10 teams, as of the live VRS, ready to fight for Counter-Strike's most prestigous title.
       
       The top half of the bracket will also see a rematch of the Austin Major grand final as Vitality take on The MongolZ.
       
       Then, hometown hero Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás's MOUZ side will take on Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's FaZe Clan to kick off Friday.
       
       Finally, world number one FURIA face Natus Vincere as Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo bids to win his first Major since 2016.

       The market currently carries a moderate-to-high risk profile as it enters the volatile Budapest Major playoff phase, though long-term sentiment is bolstered by the confirmed 2026 Major cycle in Singapore.

       Matchups set for Budapest Major playoffs

       8-12-2025 06:26
       NiKo will face donk for the fourth time in 2025.
       
       
       Spirit will face Falcons in the marquee matchup of the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs, as an in-form Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets looks to overcome Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač for the first time in 2025.
       
       The only team to not return to playoffs after making top-eight in Austin is paiN, with Falcons replacing them in what is already the Saudi organization's best result at a Valve-sponsored event.
       
       That makes it a stacked bracket consisting of eight top-10 teams, as of the live VRS, ready to fight for Counter-Strike's most prestigous title.
       
       The top half of the bracket will also see a rematch of the Austin Major grand final as Vitality take on The MongolZ.
       
       Then, hometown hero Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás's MOUZ side will take on Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's FaZe Clan to kick off Friday.
       
       Finally, world number one FURIA face Natus Vincere as Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo bids to win his first Major since 2016.

       PGL announce Singapore Major in 2026
       LucasAM
       8-12-2025 11:18
       The event will serve as the second Major of the year, running between November and December.
       
       
       PGL has announced that it will host the second Major of 2026 in Singapore on November 25-December 13 featuring a $1,250,000 prize pool.
       
       The Major will have 32 teams playing through three stages before moving to the 12,000 capacity Singapore Indoor Stadium for the playoffs, where the tournament will conclude with a best-of-five grand final to crown the champion.
       
       After the Perfect World Shanghai Major broke the barrier for the whole of Asia to get Counter-Strike's most prestigious event in 2024, PGL will now bring a Major to Southeast Asia for the first time.
       
       The event in Singapore will mark PGL's fifth time hosting a Major after PGL Krakow 2017, PGL Stockholm 2021, PGL Antwerp 2022, and PGL Copenhagen 2024. PGL has also hosted several DOTA 2 events in Singapore, including The International in 2022.
       
       "Singapore has been host to exciting esports events such as The International, the largest DOTA 2 esports event in the world, and we look forward with much anticipation to hosting our first Counter Strike Major in 2026, which will reinforce Singapore as a world-class events destination," says Ms. Jean Ng, an Assistant Chief Executive from the Singapore Tourism Board.
       
       "As one of the most prestigious tournaments in the Counter-Strike scene, the event promises to attract fans from around the region, and we invite them to also enjoy Singapore’s lifestyle experiences and vibrant energy."
       
       
       
       
       Falcons top ESL's final Annual Club Incentive 2025 standings
       Sumljiv
       8-12-2025 19:38
       The Saudi organization had the best viewership figures across ESL's events and will thus receive just over $400,000.
       
       
       ESL have released the final standings of their Annual Club Incentive program for 2025 after the conclusion of IEM Chengdu, with its $2,950,000 prizepool set to be paid out in the first quarter of 2026.
       
       The Annual Club Incentive program is a non-exclusive system designed to reward teams for their contribution to the ESL Pro Tour "in the form of tournament attendance, viewership as well as promotional activities related to ESL events," and is now set to pay out the top 16 teams ranked by their average concurrent viewers in the group stages.
       
       Falcons have topped the standings and will therefore take home $407,422, just ahead of The MongolZ, who rose from fourth to second after IEM Chengdu and will now pocket $295,313, while FURIA, Natus Vincere, and Vitality round out the top five.
       
       The program will come back for a second installment in 2026, with the first event of the year being IEM Krakow, set to being on January 28.
       
       The top five in the Annual Club Incentive standings and their prize money are:
       
       Europe Falcons - $407,422
       
       Mongolia The MongolZ - $295,313
       
       Brazil FURIA - $281,250
       
       Europe Natus Vincere - $278,906

B1ad3 on w0nderful: "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments"
king_dempz & Nohte
9-12-2025 17:18
"Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past," NAVI's coach says. "This tournament, he's amazing."


Natus Vincere breezed through Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 3-0 record, but needed until the final 2-2 pool in Stage 3 to lock in a playoff berth.

The 2024 Team of the Year has only a single title to its name in 2025, at StarLadder StarSeries Fall, and has struggled to consistently contend for trophies at the biggest events with discussions swirling about potential changes.

Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov has been on the receiving end of much of the community's critique, but it is his form — and a mentality shift — that has served NAVI so well in Budapest as he averaged a 1.77 rating in Stage 2 and a 1.30 rating in Stage 3 to reach the playoffs.

"He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present," Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy told HLTV after NAVI qualified for the playoffs. "In this tournament he just came and played really good."

NAVI aren't getting ahead of themselves going into the bracket stage, though, with plans to just focus on the process.

"I think we should go one by one," B1ad3 says. "We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works."


Watch the interview here.

First off, how are you feeling?

I'm feeling very good. Relieved, I feel relieved.

Let's talk about that series. It seemed like you had a very good gameplan on Ancient, a good idea of what B8 wanted to do. How did that map go from your perspective?

Amazing. I think they trusted this map a lot and we prepped pretty good, we knew what they were doing. The composure of our players and the whole team synergy-wise was very good, we were on the same page moving around the map, very confident. It was a very good map.

Train was a lot closer, it felt like your team gave up a lot of advantages, particularly in the second half. How did it go from your point of view?

I think we relaxed a little bit on the T side of Train, for sure. There was one round when we didn't do something as one unit, and we were just basically doing three different ideas thinking that we are playing versus some dogs, I don't know, and lost the round instantly.

We spoke about this before the second map, we said it was very important to start sharp and not give any free rounds, because they instantly feel the hope of coming back. If you become more confident your ideas flow differently at that moment. These details are crucial in my opinion, especially in these kind of matches where it's the last chance to qualify for playoffs.

We worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly
Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
Just to talk about the rest of your Major campaign: you started with that difficult loss against FURIA. What do you think went wrong in that game for you?

I think firepower first of all. We couldn't out-aim where we expected to out-aim, let's say, and in MR12, especially in best-of-one, a lot of close rounds are important, when you play 2vs2 or 3vs3, and we lost all of them, where in most of them we have advantage positioning-wise and in map control.

This is what we usually work on, how to fix this, before the game and after the game, so we work on these aspects a lot. I also think one more important thing happened: we worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly. Nowadays it's one of the most important things.

In that specific game against FURIA we were not ready to show our best, we were not ready to… basically you can have a specific mode when you play as a team, where you are constantly seeking solutions or trying to solve the riddle let's say, and you need to do it very fast and not separately. We usually try to get into this mode more and more, but when we started to lose the reactions were kind of hard to make.

We were struggling, you need so much sweat to do something, which is usually where you are a little bit shackled and you don't know what the best solution is. When you are free in your mind, floating and connecting to each other, it goes much better, and this is what we are usually trying to work on and speak about because it is important for our system. They had a good gameplan countering us outside, and I think us dying a lot and failing outside was 50% of the loss.

When you get beaten like that, when the score is very one-sided, is it easy to recover and reset after the game?

After the game, yes, if you know your potential and you don't need to persuade people into believing in themselves. We usually have a lot of material, this example and this example and this example, and you can always compare: you know how you play basically.

If you played really, really good in your opinion and they smashed you in this… kind of fiasco, there's nothing you can do, you can just think they are better. If you know you can play better, it's a different story. Also maybe they forced you, with their style, to play bad, you can also think about this. You need to try and find the real reasons for the loss, not be blind or blame somebody.

Before this game you had a close match against Vitality with two very close maps, on a different day you could have won that series. What are your reflections on it?

In the Vitality match I think w0nderful was playing amazing first of all, and I think this is a crucial part of this kind of score. We did a lot of mistakes, they did a lot of mistakes, I think that both teams were not playing their best for sure at that moment. So on the one hand I feel positive and glad that we played like this, but on the other hand I think if Vitality played better we would lose much harder.


I wanted to ask about w0nderful: he's having one of the best tournaments of the season for him so far, and Aleksib talked about his confidence and how that's helping him. I just wondered if you had done anything as a coach to help him get into some better form?

Yeah. He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good.

Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past. This tournament, he's amazing, he's showing very good performance, and with this performance I think you can win tournaments. This is important to understand.

Also there was a game versus Vitality where he was not playing good and I was trying to help him, 'please don't overthink this, just try to find something easy, an easy approach that you are usually comfortable with.' Because if you start thinking what your next step should be and hesitating, 'maybe not this, maybe this,' you are already in a trap.

The performance coach [was] speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, [...] he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good
Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy on w0nderful
You have a few days to prepare now and think about the playoffs. For a team like NAVI who are famous for playing much better after a bootcamp, and famous for having good preparation, do you think these few days are almost more important for your team than others?

I don't know how others usually prep or spend their time, but yeah for us this is important. Every day is crucial because we can review something, we can add or upgrade something, work on weak maps, very useful time. But sometimes, if you are 3-0 for example, it can be hard because too many days without this energy of the arena, you cool down a little bit, which can be bad.

So it's good that it's not too many free days at the same time. I think for us it's very crucial to go into the first match with the same energy that we absorbed from these matches in Stage 2 and Stage 3, and it's very cool that they had everything on the stage.

With those days to prepare, with the form that you've been in, with the fact that you've had a lot of games to soak up that atmosphere and to work on your form, what are you looking at in the playoffs as your goal or expectation? Do you think you can go all the way and win this one?

I think we should go one by one. We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works. Four of these players were winning tournaments, team of the year, it just needs to be activated in the proper moment.

We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try
Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
Opponents are very tough obviously, they're in very good shape, like Spirit with donk, or FURIA playing amazing. We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try.

This is StarLadder's first Major for many years: what's the experience been like during this Major?

Honestly, we liked everything. We spoke with the players. I think they are doing a great job, if you compare all the details with other tournaments, they are not lower than ESL or BLAST for sure. All criteria are on the highest level, let's see what it will be like in the playoffs.

The Danish sniper is on the way out of Astralis for the second time.


Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz is expected to join 100 Thieves as their sniper, with negotiations between the two parties at an advanced stage according to multiple sources speaking to HLTV and Dust2.dk.

The move is expected to reunite him with long-time Astralis teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, who is set to take over as the team's coach.

Sources: gla1ve set to join 100 Thieves as coach
device joining 100 Thieves would mark the end of his second tenure with Astralis, which began in October 2022 after his return from Ninjas in Pyjamas.

During this period, device played a key role in guiding the team to the grand finals of PGL Astana and FISSURE Playground 1, and notably helped secure their first Major appearance in three years. However, Astralis were unable to advance past Stage 2 in Budapest.

device: "A lot of this year has been, in some way, a wake-up call for me to figure out how I can be the player I want to be"
With the Danes' signing, 100 Thieves' roster would feature Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard and device, meaning they would be required to sign a three-man core in order to start 2026 with a VRS ranking.

100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.

Following recent reports, 100 Thieves would be:

Norway Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard
Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz

Denmark Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander (coach)


Official: paiN remove dgt and dav1deuS*
Sumljiv
9-12-2025 22:40
The duo departed the team after a disappointing season.


Update 23:06 :

paiN have confirmed the report by announcing the duo's benching with immediate effect.

paiN are set to move Franco "⁠dgt⁠" Garcia and David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado to the bench after a period of lackluster results, according to a report by Dust2.com.br.

Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's troops had a breakthrough top-four result at the Austin Major to go into the summer break full of expectations, but the majority-Brazilian lineup was unable to repeat the success.

paiN made just one semi-final in the second part of the season, at BLAST Rivals Season 2, and most recently exited the Major with a 1-3 record in Stage 3.

biguzera: "We didn't deserve to go through. We had some very bad games and made some very silly mistakes"
dav1deuS, who joined the team in January, had an especially tough time in Budapest and averaged a 0.85 rating, a big drop from his 1.02 average across the year, while dgt was paiN's second highest-rated performer in Hungary behind captain biguzera.

With the changes, paiN would be:

Brazil Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt
Brazil Lucas "⁠nqz⁠" Soares
Brazil João "⁠snow⁠" Vinicius

Brazil Henrique "⁠rikz⁠" Waku (coach)

Chile David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado (benched)

15:20:32 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:20:32 | INFO     | The market is currently entering a high-volatility phase as the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs coincide with seismic roster news, most notably the departure of device and gla1ve from Astralis to 100 Thieves. NAVI assets, specifically w0nderful autographs, represent the strongest growth potential following his elite 1.77 rating and the team’s playoff qualification, while paiN Gaming stickers face immediate devaluation due to roster benchings. Traders should capitalize on the "end-of-era" speculative interest in Astralis stickers before the market shifts focus toward the upcoming 100 Thieves entry in 2026.

**Risk Level:** High
**Recommendation:** Buy (Selective: NAVI team stickers and device legacy autographs)

       B1ad3 on w0nderful: "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments"

       "Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past," NAVI's coach says. "This tournament, he's amazing."
       
       
       Natus Vincere breezed through Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 3-0 record, but needed until the final 2-2 pool in Stage 3 to lock in a playoff berth.
       
       The 2024 Team of the Year has only a single title to its name in 2025, at StarLadder StarSeries Fall, and has struggled to consistently contend for trophies at the biggest events with discussions swirling about potential changes.
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov has been on the receiving end of much of the community's critique, but it is his form — and a mentality shift — that has served NAVI so well in Budapest as he averaged a 1.77 rating in Stage 2 and a 1.30 rating in Stage 3 to reach the playoffs.
       
       "He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present," Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy told HLTV after NAVI qualified for the playoffs. "In this tournament he just came and played really good."
       
       NAVI aren't getting ahead of themselves going into the bracket stage, though, with plans to just focus on the process.
       
       "I think we should go one by one," B1ad3 says. "We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works."
       
       
       Watch the interview here.
       
       First off, how are you feeling?
       
       I'm feeling very good. Relieved, I feel relieved.
       
       Let's talk about that series. It seemed like you had a very good gameplan on Ancient, a good idea of what B8 wanted to do. How did that map go from your perspective?
       
       Amazing. I think they trusted this map a lot and we prepped pretty good, we knew what they were doing. The composure of our players and the whole team synergy-wise was very good, we were on the same page moving around the map, very confident. It was a very good map.
       
       Train was a lot closer, it felt like your team gave up a lot of advantages, particularly in the second half. How did it go from your point of view?
       
       I think we relaxed a little bit on the T side of Train, for sure. There was one round when we didn't do something as one unit, and we were just basically doing three different ideas thinking that we are playing versus some dogs, I don't know, and lost the round instantly.
       
       We spoke about this before the second map, we said it was very important to start sharp and not give any free rounds, because they instantly feel the hope of coming back. If you become more confident your ideas flow differently at that moment. These details are crucial in my opinion, especially in these kind of matches where it's the last chance to qualify for playoffs.
       
       We worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Just to talk about the rest of your Major campaign: you started with that difficult loss against FURIA. What do you think went wrong in that game for you?
       
       I think firepower first of all. We couldn't out-aim where we expected to out-aim, let's say, and in MR12, especially in best-of-one, a lot of close rounds are important, when you play 2vs2 or 3vs3, and we lost all of them, where in most of them we have advantage positioning-wise and in map control.
       
       This is what we usually work on, how to fix this, before the game and after the game, so we work on these aspects a lot. I also think one more important thing happened: we worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly. Nowadays it's one of the most important things.
       
       In that specific game against FURIA we were not ready to show our best, we were not ready to… basically you can have a specific mode when you play as a team, where you are constantly seeking solutions or trying to solve the riddle let's say, and you need to do it very fast and not separately. We usually try to get into this mode more and more, but when we started to lose the reactions were kind of hard to make.
       
       We were struggling, you need so much sweat to do something, which is usually where you are a little bit shackled and you don't know what the best solution is. When you are free in your mind, floating and connecting to each other, it goes much better, and this is what we are usually trying to work on and speak about because it is important for our system. They had a good gameplan countering us outside, and I think us dying a lot and failing outside was 50% of the loss.
       
       When you get beaten like that, when the score is very one-sided, is it easy to recover and reset after the game?
       
       After the game, yes, if you know your potential and you don't need to persuade people into believing in themselves. We usually have a lot of material, this example and this example and this example, and you can always compare: you know how you play basically.
       
       If you played really, really good in your opinion and they smashed you in this… kind of fiasco, there's nothing you can do, you can just think they are better. If you know you can play better, it's a different story. Also maybe they forced you, with their style, to play bad, you can also think about this. You need to try and find the real reasons for the loss, not be blind or blame somebody.
       
       Before this game you had a close match against Vitality with two very close maps, on a different day you could have won that series. What are your reflections on it?
       
       In the Vitality match I think w0nderful was playing amazing first of all, and I think this is a crucial part of this kind of score. We did a lot of mistakes, they did a lot of mistakes, I think that both teams were not playing their best for sure at that moment. So on the one hand I feel positive and glad that we played like this, but on the other hand I think if Vitality played better we would lose much harder.
       
       
       I wanted to ask about w0nderful: he's having one of the best tournaments of the season for him so far, and Aleksib talked about his confidence and how that's helping him. I just wondered if you had done anything as a coach to help him get into some better form?
       
       Yeah. He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good.
       
       Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past. This tournament, he's amazing, he's showing very good performance, and with this performance I think you can win tournaments. This is important to understand.
       
       Also there was a game versus Vitality where he was not playing good and I was trying to help him, 'please don't overthink this, just try to find something easy, an easy approach that you are usually comfortable with.' Because if you start thinking what your next step should be and hesitating, 'maybe not this, maybe this,' you are already in a trap.
       
       The performance coach [was] speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, [...] he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy on w0nderful
       You have a few days to prepare now and think about the playoffs. For a team like NAVI who are famous for playing much better after a bootcamp, and famous for having good preparation, do you think these few days are almost more important for your team than others?
       
       I don't know how others usually prep or spend their time, but yeah for us this is important. Every day is crucial because we can review something, we can add or upgrade something, work on weak maps, very useful time. But sometimes, if you are 3-0 for example, it can be hard because too many days without this energy of the arena, you cool down a little bit, which can be bad.
       
       So it's good that it's not too many free days at the same time. I think for us it's very crucial to go into the first match with the same energy that we absorbed from these matches in Stage 2 and Stage 3, and it's very cool that they had everything on the stage.
       
       With those days to prepare, with the form that you've been in, with the fact that you've had a lot of games to soak up that atmosphere and to work on your form, what are you looking at in the playoffs as your goal or expectation? Do you think you can go all the way and win this one?
       
       I think we should go one by one. We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works. Four of these players were winning tournaments, team of the year, it just needs to be activated in the proper moment.
       
       We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Opponents are very tough obviously, they're in very good shape, like Spirit with donk, or FURIA playing amazing. We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try.
       
       This is StarLadder's first Major for many years: what's the experience been like during this Major?
       
       Honestly, we liked everything. We spoke with the players. I think they are doing a great job, if you compare all the details with other tournaments, they are not lower than ESL or BLAST for sure. All criteria are on the highest level, let's see what it will be like in the playoffs.

       The Danish sniper is on the way out of Astralis for the second time.
       
       
       Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz is expected to join 100 Thieves as their sniper, with negotiations between the two parties at an advanced stage according to multiple sources speaking to HLTV and Dust2.dk.
       
       The move is expected to reunite him with long-time Astralis teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, who is set to take over as the team's coach.

       device joining 100 Thieves would mark the end of his second tenure with Astralis, which began in October 2022 after his return from Ninjas in Pyjamas.
       
       During this period, device played a key role in guiding the team to the grand finals of PGL Astana and FISSURE Playground 1, and notably helped secure their first Major appearance in three years. However, Astralis were unable to advance past Stage 2 in Budapest.

       With the Danes' signing, 100 Thieves' roster would feature Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard and device, meaning they would be required to sign a three-man core in order to start 2026 with a VRS ranking.
       
       100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.
       
       Following recent reports, 100 Thieves would be:
       
       Norway Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard

       The duo departed the team after a disappointing season.
       
       
       Update 23:06 :
       
       paiN have confirmed the report by announcing the duo's benching with immediate effect.
       
       paiN are set to move Franco "⁠dgt⁠" Garcia and David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado to the bench after a period of lackluster results, according to a report by Dust2.com.br.
       
       Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's troops had a breakthrough top-four result at the Austin Major to go into the summer break full of expectations, but the majority-Brazilian lineup was unable to repeat the success.
       
       paiN made just one semi-final in the second part of the season, at BLAST Rivals Season 2, and most recently exited the Major with a 1-3 record in Stage 3.

       dav1deuS, who joined the team in January, had an especially tough time in Budapest and averaged a 0.85 rating, a big drop from his 1.02 average across the year, while dgt was paiN's second highest-rated performer in Hungary behind captain biguzera.
       
       With the changes, paiN would be:
       
       Brazil Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt
       Brazil Lucas "⁠nqz⁠" Soares
       Brazil João "⁠snow⁠" Vinicius

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently entering a high-volatility phase as the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs coincide with seismic roster news, most notably the departure of device and gla1ve from Astralis to 100 Thieves. NAVI assets, specifically w0nderful autographs, represent the strongest growth potential following his elite 1.77 rating and the team’s playoff qualification, while paiN Gaming stickers face immediate devaluation due to roster benchings. Traders should capitalize on the "end-of-era" speculative interest in Astralis stickers before the market shifts focus toward the upcoming 100 Thieves entry in 2026.
       
       **Risk Level:** High
       **Recommendation:** Buy (Selective: NAVI team stickers and device legacy autographs)
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a 4.60% loss, taking profit is not an option, so you should only cut your loss if you believe the asset's value will continue to decline.

You need to try and find the real reasons for the loss, not be blind or blame somebody.
       
       Before this game you had a close match against Vitality with two very close maps, on a different day you could have won that series. What are your reflections on it?
       
       In the Vitality match I think w0nderful was playing amazing first of all, and I think this is a crucial part of this kind of score. We did a lot of mistakes, they did a lot of mistakes, I think that both teams were not playing their best for sure at that moment. So on the one hand I feel positive and glad that we played like this, but on the other hand I think if Vitality played better we would lose much harder.

This tournament, he's amazing, he's showing very good performance, and with this performance I think you can win tournaments. This is important to understand.
       
       Also there was a game versus Vitality where he was not playing good and I was trying to help him, 'please don't overthink this, just try to find something easy, an easy approach that you are usually comfortable with.' Because if you start thinking what your next step should be and hesitating, 'maybe not this, maybe this,' you are already in a trap.

       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy on w0nderful
       You have a few days to prepare now and think about the playoffs. For a team like NAVI who are famous for playing much better after a bootcamp, and famous for having good preparation, do you think these few days are almost more important for your team than others?
       
       I don't know how others usually prep or spend their time, but yeah for us this is important. Every day is crucial because we can review something, we can add or upgrade something, work on weak maps, very useful time. But sometimes, if you are 3-0 for example, it can be hard because too many days without this energy of the arena, you cool down a little bit, which can be bad.
       
       So it's good that it's not too many free days at the same time. I think for us it's very crucial to go into the first match with the same energy that we absorbed from these matches in Stage 2 and Stage 3, and it's very cool that they had everything on the stage.
       
       With those days to prepare, with the form that you've been in, with the fact that you've had a lot of games to soak up that atmosphere and to work on your form, what are you looking at in the playoffs as your goal or expectation? Do you think you can go all the way and win this one?
       
       I think we should go one by one. We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works. Four of these players were winning tournaments, team of the year, it just needs to be activated in the proper moment.
       
       We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Opponents are very tough obviously, they're in very good shape, like Spirit with donk, or FURIA playing amazing. We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try.
       
       This is StarLadder's first Major for many years: what's the experience been like during this Major?
       
       Honestly, we liked everything. We spoke with the players. I think they are doing a great job, if you compare all the details with other tournaments, they are not lower than ESL or BLAST for sure. All criteria are on the highest level, let's see what it will be like in the playoffs.

       The Danish sniper is on the way out of Astralis for the second time.
       
       
       Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz is expected to join 100 Thieves as their sniper, with negotiations between the two parties at an advanced stage according to multiple sources speaking to HLTV and Dust2.dk.
       
       The move is expected to reunite him with long-time Astralis teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, who is set to take over as the team's coach.

       device joining 100 Thieves would mark the end of his second tenure with Astralis, which began in October 2022 after his return from Ninjas in Pyjamas.
       
       During this period, device played a key role in guiding the team to the grand finals of PGL Astana and FISSURE Playground 1, and notably helped secure their first Major appearance in three years. However, Astralis were unable to advance past Stage 2 in Budapest.

       With the Danes' signing, 100 Thieves' roster would feature Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard and device, meaning they would be required to sign a three-man core in order to start 2026 with a VRS ranking.
       
       100 Thieves were not immediately available for comment.
       
       Following recent reports, 100 Thieves would be:

       The duo departed the team after a disappointing season.
       
       
       Update 23:06 :
       
       paiN have confirmed the report by announcing the duo's benching with immediate effect.
       
       paiN are set to move Franco "⁠dgt⁠" Garcia and David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado to the bench after a period of lackluster results, according to a report by Dust2.com.br.
       
       Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's troops had a breakthrough top-four result at the Austin Major to go into the summer break full of expectations, but the majority-Brazilian lineup was unable to repeat the success.
       
       paiN made just one semi-final in the second part of the season, at BLAST Rivals Season 2, and most recently exited the Major with a 1-3 record in Stage 3.

       With the changes, paiN would be:

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently entering a high-volatility phase as the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs coincide with seismic roster news, most notably the departure of device and gla1ve from Astralis to 100 Thieves. NAVI assets, specifically w0nderful autographs, represent the strongest growth potential following his elite 1.77 rating and the team’s playoff qualification, while paiN Gaming stickers face immediate devaluation due to roster benchings. Traders should capitalize on the "end-of-era" speculative interest in Astralis stickers before the market shifts focus toward the upcoming 100 Thieves entry in 2026.
       
       **Risk Level:** High
       **Recommendation:** Buy (Selective: NAVI team stickers and device legacy autographs)
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are at break-even and the price is at a baseline floor, hold the asset and wait for potential upward momentum before exiting.

       B1ad3 on w0nderful: "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments"
       king_dempz & Nohte
       9-12-2025 17:18
       "Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past," NAVI's coach says. "This tournament, he's amazing."
       
       
       Natus Vincere breezed through Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 3-0 record, but needed until the final 2-2 pool in Stage 3 to lock in a playoff berth.
       
       The 2024 Team of the Year has only a single title to its name in 2025, at StarLadder StarSeries Fall, and has struggled to consistently contend for trophies at the biggest events with discussions swirling about potential changes.
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov has been on the receiving end of much of the community's critique, but it is his form — and a mentality shift — that has served NAVI so well in Budapest as he averaged a 1.77 rating in Stage 2 and a 1.30 rating in Stage 3 to reach the playoffs.
       
       "He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present," Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy told HLTV after NAVI qualified for the playoffs. "In this tournament he just came and played really good."
       
       NAVI aren't getting ahead of themselves going into the bracket stage, though, with plans to just focus on the process.
       
       "I think we should go one by one," B1ad3 says. "We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works."
       
       
       Watch the interview here.
       
       First off, how are you feeling?
       
       I'm feeling very good. Relieved, I feel relieved.
       
       Let's talk about that series. It seemed like you had a very good gameplan on Ancient, a good idea of what B8 wanted to do. How did that map go from your perspective?
       
       Amazing. I think they trusted this map a lot and we prepped pretty good, we knew what they were doing. The composure of our players and the whole team synergy-wise was very good, we were on the same page moving around the map, very confident. It was a very good map.
       
       Train was a lot closer, it felt like your team gave up a lot of advantages, particularly in the second half. How did it go from your point of view?
       
       I think we relaxed a little bit on the T side of Train, for sure. There was one round when we didn't do something as one unit, and we were just basically doing three different ideas thinking that we are playing versus some dogs, I don't know, and lost the round instantly.
       
       We spoke about this before the second map, we said it was very important to start sharp and not give any free rounds, because they instantly feel the hope of coming back. If you become more confident your ideas flow differently at that moment. These details are crucial in my opinion, especially in these kind of matches where it's the last chance to qualify for playoffs.
       
       We worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Just to talk about the rest of your Major campaign: you started with that difficult loss against FURIA. What do you think went wrong in that game for you?
       
       I think firepower first of all. We couldn't out-aim where we expected to out-aim, let's say, and in MR12, especially in best-of-one, a lot of close rounds are important, when you play 2vs2 or 3vs3, and we lost all of them, where in most of them we have advantage positioning-wise and in map control.
       
       This is what we usually work on, how to fix this, before the game and after the game, so we work on these aspects a lot. I also think one more important thing happened: we worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly. Nowadays it's one of the most important things.
       
       In that specific game against FURIA we were not ready to show our best, we were not ready to… basically you can have a specific mode when you play as a team, where you are constantly seeking solutions or trying to solve the riddle let's say, and you need to do it very fast and not separately. We usually try to get into this mode more and more, but when we started to lose the reactions were kind of hard to make.
       
       We were struggling, you need so much sweat to do something, which is usually where you are a little bit shackled and you don't know what the best solution is. When you are free in your mind, floating and connecting to each other, it goes much better, and this is what we are usually trying to work on and speak about because it is important for our system. They had a good gameplan countering us outside, and I think us dying a lot and failing outside was 50% of the loss.
       
       When you get beaten like that, when the score is very one-sided, is it easy to recover and reset after the game?
       
       After the game, yes, if you know your potential and you don't need to persuade people into believing in themselves. We usually have a lot of material, this example and this example and this example, and you can always compare: you know how you play basically.
       
       If you played really, really good in your opinion and they smashed you in this… kind of fiasco, there's nothing you can do, you can just think they are better. If you know you can play better, it's a different story. Also maybe they forced you, with their style, to play bad, you can also think about this. You need to try and find the real reasons for the loss, not be blind or blame somebody.
       
       Before this game you had a close match against Vitality with two very close maps, on a different day you could have won that series. What are your reflections on it?
       
       In the Vitality match I think w0nderful was playing amazing first of all, and I think this is a crucial part of this kind of score. We did a lot of mistakes, they did a lot of mistakes, I think that both teams were not playing their best for sure at that moment. So on the one hand I feel positive and glad that we played like this, but on the other hand I think if Vitality played better we would lose much harder.
       
       
       I wanted to ask about w0nderful: he's having one of the best tournaments of the season for him so far, and Aleksib talked about his confidence and how that's helping him. I just wondered if you had done anything as a coach to help him get into some better form?
       
       Yeah. He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good.
       
       Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past. This tournament, he's amazing, he's showing very good performance, and with this performance I think you can win tournaments. This is important to understand.
       
       Also there was a game versus Vitality where he was not playing good and I was trying to help him, 'please don't overthink this, just try to find something easy, an easy approach that you are usually comfortable with.' Because if you start thinking what your next step should be and hesitating, 'maybe not this, maybe this,' you are already in a trap.
       
       The performance coach [was] speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, [...] he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy on w0nderful
       You have a few days to prepare now and think about the playoffs. For a team like NAVI who are famous for playing much better after a bootcamp, and famous for having good preparation, do you think these few days are almost more important for your team than others?
       
       I don't know how others usually prep or spend their time, but yeah for us this is important. Every day is crucial because we can review something, we can add or upgrade something, work on weak maps, very useful time. But sometimes, if you are 3-0 for example, it can be hard because too many days without this energy of the arena, you cool down a little bit, which can be bad.
       
       So it's good that it's not too many free days at the same time. I think for us it's very crucial to go into the first match with the same energy that we absorbed from these matches in Stage 2 and Stage 3, and it's very cool that they had everything on the stage.
       
       With those days to prepare, with the form that you've been in, with the fact that you've had a lot of games to soak up that atmosphere and to work on your form, what are you looking at in the playoffs as your goal or expectation? Do you think you can go all the way and win this one?
       
       I think we should go one by one. We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works. Four of these players were winning tournaments, team of the year, it just needs to be activated in the proper moment.
       
       We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Opponents are very tough obviously, they're in very good shape, like Spirit with donk, or FURIA playing amazing. We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try.
       
       This is StarLadder's first Major for many years: what's the experience been like during this Major?
       
       Honestly, we liked everything. We spoke with the players. I think they are doing a great job, if you compare all the details with other tournaments, they are not lower than ESL or BLAST for sure. All criteria are on the highest level, let's see what it will be like in the playoffs.

       Train was a lot closer, it felt like your team gave up a lot of advantages, particularly in the second half. How did it go from your point of view?
       
       I think we relaxed a little bit on the T side of Train, for sure. There was one round when we didn't do something as one unit, and we were just basically doing three different ideas thinking that we are playing versus some dogs, I don't know, and lost the round instantly.
       
       We spoke about this before the second map, we said it was very important to start sharp and not give any free rounds, because they instantly feel the hope of coming back. If you become more confident your ideas flow differently at that moment. These details are crucial in my opinion, especially in these kind of matches where it's the last chance to qualify for playoffs.
       
       We worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Just to talk about the rest of your Major campaign: you started with that difficult loss against FURIA. What do you think went wrong in that game for you?
       
       I think firepower first of all. We couldn't out-aim where we expected to out-aim, let's say, and in MR12, especially in best-of-one, a lot of close rounds are important, when you play 2vs2 or 3vs3, and we lost all of them, where in most of them we have advantage positioning-wise and in map control.
       
       This is what we usually work on, how to fix this, before the game and after the game, so we work on these aspects a lot. I also think one more important thing happened: we worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly. Nowadays it's one of the most important things.
       
       In that specific game against FURIA we were not ready to show our best, we were not ready to… basically you can have a specific mode when you play as a team, where you are constantly seeking solutions or trying to solve the riddle let's say, and you need to do it very fast and not separately. We usually try to get into this mode more and more, but when we started to lose the reactions were kind of hard to make.
       
       We were struggling, you need so much sweat to do something, which is usually where you are a little bit shackled and you don't know what the best solution is. When you are free in your mind, floating and connecting to each other, it goes much better, and this is what we are usually trying to work on and speak about because it is important for our system. They had a good gameplan countering us outside, and I think us dying a lot and failing outside was 50% of the loss.
       
       When you get beaten like that, when the score is very one-sided, is it easy to recover and reset after the game?
       
       After the game, yes, if you know your potential and you don't need to persuade people into believing in themselves. We usually have a lot of material, this example and this example and this example, and you can always compare: you know how you play basically.
       
       If you played really, really good in your opinion and they smashed you in this… kind of fiasco, there's nothing you can do, you can just think they are better. If you know you can play better, it's a different story. Also maybe they forced you, with their style, to play bad, you can also think about this. You need to try and find the real reasons for the loss, not be blind or blame somebody.
       
       Before this game you had a close match against Vitality with two very close maps, on a different day you could have won that series. What are your reflections on it?
       
       In the Vitality match I think w0nderful was playing amazing first of all, and I think this is a crucial part of this kind of score. We did a lot of mistakes, they did a lot of mistakes, I think that both teams were not playing their best for sure at that moment. So on the one hand I feel positive and glad that we played like this, but on the other hand I think if Vitality played better we would lose much harder.
       
       
       I wanted to ask about w0nderful: he's having one of the best tournaments of the season for him so far, and Aleksib talked about his confidence and how that's helping him. I just wondered if you had done anything as a coach to help him get into some better form?
       
       Yeah. He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good.
       
       Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past. This tournament, he's amazing, he's showing very good performance, and with this performance I think you can win tournaments. This is important to understand.
       
       Also there was a game versus Vitality where he was not playing good and I was trying to help him, 'please don't overthink this, just try to find something easy, an easy approach that you are usually comfortable with.' Because if you start thinking what your next step should be and hesitating, 'maybe not this, maybe this,' you are already in a trap.
       
       The performance coach [was] speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, [...] he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy on w0nderful
       You have a few days to prepare now and think about the playoffs. For a team like NAVI who are famous for playing much better after a bootcamp, and famous for having good preparation, do you think these few days are almost more important for your team than others?
       
       I don't know how others usually prep or spend their time, but yeah for us this is important. Every day is crucial because we can review something, we can add or upgrade something, work on weak maps, very useful time. But sometimes, if you are 3-0 for example, it can be hard because too many days without this energy of the arena, you cool down a little bit, which can be bad.
       
       So it's good that it's not too many free days at the same time. I think for us it's very crucial to go into the first match with the same energy that we absorbed from these matches in Stage 2 and Stage 3, and it's very cool that they had everything on the stage.
       
       With those days to prepare, with the form that you've been in, with the fact that you've had a lot of games to soak up that atmosphere and to work on your form, what are you looking at in the playoffs as your goal or expectation? Do you think you can go all the way and win this one?
       
       I think we should go one by one. We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works. Four of these players were winning tournaments, team of the year, it just needs to be activated in the proper moment.
       
       We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Opponents are very tough obviously, they're in very good shape, like Spirit with donk, or FURIA playing amazing. We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try.
       
       This is StarLadder's first Major for many years: what's the experience been like during this Major?
       
       Honestly, we liked everything. We spoke with the players. I think they are doing a great job, if you compare all the details with other tournaments, they are not lower than ESL or BLAST for sure. All criteria are on the highest level, let's see what it will be like in the playoffs.

       device joining 100 Thieves would mark the end of his second tenure with Astralis, which began in October 2022 after his return from Ninjas in Pyjamas.
       
       During this period, device played a key role in guiding the team to the grand finals of PGL Astana and FISSURE Playground 1, and notably helped secure their first Major appearance in three years. However, Astralis were unable to advance past Stage 2 in Budapest.

       paiN have confirmed the report by announcing the duo's benching with immediate effect.
       
       paiN are set to move Franco "⁠dgt⁠" Garcia and David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado to the bench after a period of lackluster results, according to a report by Dust2.com.br.
       
       Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's troops had a breakthrough top-four result at the Austin Major to go into the summer break full of expectations, but the majority-Brazilian lineup was unable to repeat the success.
       
       paiN made just one semi-final in the second part of the season, at BLAST Rivals Season 2, and most recently exited the Major with a 1-3 record in Stage 3.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently entering a high-volatility phase as the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs coincide with seismic roster news, most notably the departure of device and gla1ve from Astralis to 100 Thieves. NAVI assets, specifically w0nderful autographs, represent the strongest growth potential following his elite 1.77 rating and the team’s playoff qualification, while paiN Gaming stickers face immediate devaluation due to roster benchings. Traders should capitalize on the "end-of-era" speculative interest in Astralis stickers before the market shifts focus toward the upcoming 100 Thieves entry in 2026.
       
       **Risk Level:** High
       **Recommendation:** Buy (Selective: NAVI team stickers and device legacy autographs)

       B1ad3 on w0nderful: "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments"

       "Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past," NAVI's coach says. "This tournament, he's amazing."
       
       
       Natus Vincere breezed through Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 3-0 record, but needed until the final 2-2 pool in Stage 3 to lock in a playoff berth.
       
       The 2024 Team of the Year has only a single title to its name in 2025, at StarLadder StarSeries Fall, and has struggled to consistently contend for trophies at the biggest events with discussions swirling about potential changes.
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov has been on the receiving end of much of the community's critique, but it is his form — and a mentality shift — that has served NAVI so well in Budapest as he averaged a 1.77 rating in Stage 2 and a 1.30 rating in Stage 3 to reach the playoffs.
       
       "He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present," Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy told HLTV after NAVI qualified for the playoffs. "In this tournament he just came and played really good."
       
       NAVI aren't getting ahead of themselves going into the bracket stage, though, with plans to just focus on the process.
       
       "I think we should go one by one," B1ad3 says. "We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works."
       
       
       Watch the interview here.
       
       First off, how are you feeling?
       
       I'm feeling very good. Relieved, I feel relieved.
       
       Let's talk about that series. It seemed like you had a very good gameplan on Ancient, a good idea of what B8 wanted to do. How did that map go from your perspective?
       
       Amazing. I think they trusted this map a lot and we prepped pretty good, we knew what they were doing. The composure of our players and the whole team synergy-wise was very good, we were on the same page moving around the map, very confident. It was a very good map.
       
       Train was a lot closer, it felt like your team gave up a lot of advantages, particularly in the second half. How did it go from your point of view?
       
       I think we relaxed a little bit on the T side of Train, for sure. There was one round when we didn't do something as one unit, and we were just basically doing three different ideas thinking that we are playing versus some dogs, I don't know, and lost the round instantly.
       
       We spoke about this before the second map, we said it was very important to start sharp and not give any free rounds, because they instantly feel the hope of coming back. If you become more confident your ideas flow differently at that moment. These details are crucial in my opinion, especially in these kind of matches where it's the last chance to qualify for playoffs.
       
       We worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy
       Just to talk about the rest of your Major campaign: you started with that difficult loss against FURIA. What do you think went wrong in that game for you?
       
       I think firepower first of all. We couldn't out-aim where we expected to out-aim, let's say, and in MR12, especially in best-of-one, a lot of close rounds are important, when you play 2vs2 or 3vs3, and we lost all of them, where in most of them we have advantage positioning-wise and in map control.
       
       This is what we usually work on, how to fix this, before the game and after the game, so we work on these aspects a lot. I also think one more important thing happened: we worked a lot with our performance coach on our mental state and our mindset, how to approach the game, constantly. Nowadays it's one of the most important things.
       
       In that specific game against FURIA we were not ready to show our best, we were not ready to… basically you can have a specific mode when you play as a team, where you are constantly seeking solutions or trying to solve the riddle let's say, and you need to do it very fast and not separately. We usually try to get into this mode more and more, but when we started to lose the reactions were kind of hard to make.

They had a good gameplan countering us outside, and I think us dying a lot and failing outside was 50% of the loss.
       
       When you get beaten like that, when the score is very one-sided, is it easy to recover and reset after the game?
       
       After the game, yes, if you know your potential and you don't need to persuade people into believing in themselves. We usually have a lot of material, this example and this example and this example, and you can always compare: you know how you play basically.
       
       If you played really, really good in your opinion and they smashed you in this… kind of fiasco, there's nothing you can do, you can just think they are better. If you know you can play better, it's a different story. Also maybe they forced you, with their style, to play bad, you can also think about this. You need to try and find the real reasons for the loss, not be blind or blame somebody.
       
       Before this game you had a close match against Vitality with two very close maps, on a different day you could have won that series. What are your reflections on it?
       
       In the Vitality match I think w0nderful was playing amazing first of all, and I think this is a crucial part of this kind of score. We did a lot of mistakes, they did a lot of mistakes, I think that both teams were not playing their best for sure at that moment. So on the one hand I feel positive and glad that we played like this, but on the other hand I think if Vitality played better we would lose much harder.
       
       
       I wanted to ask about w0nderful: he's having one of the best tournaments of the season for him so far, and Aleksib talked about his confidence and how that's helping him. I just wondered if you had done anything as a coach to help him get into some better form?
       
       Yeah. He had a very bad bootcamp performance so we were constantly working on this aspect, like the performance coach speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, something was happening in his head and he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good.
       
       Usually he has a very good performance in bootcamps and then he starts to be a bit nervous, or a bit shaky, something happens sometimes in the past. This tournament, he's amazing, he's showing very good performance, and with this performance I think you can win tournaments. This is important to understand.
       
       Also there was a game versus Vitality where he was not playing good and I was trying to help him, 'please don't overthink this, just try to find something easy, an easy approach that you are usually comfortable with.' Because if you start thinking what your next step should be and hesitating, 'maybe not this, maybe this,' you are already in a trap.
       
       The performance coach [was] speaking with him, trying to fix his… let's say the skeletons in his closet, [...] he was not present. In this tournament he just came and played really good
       Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy on w0nderful
       You have a few days to prepare now and think about the playoffs. For a team like NAVI who are famous for playing much better after a bootcamp, and famous for having good preparation, do you think these few days are almost more important for your team than others?
       
       I don't know how others usually prep or spend their time, but yeah for us this is important. Every day is crucial because we can review something, we can add or upgrade something, work on weak maps, very useful time. But sometimes, if you are 3-0 for example, it can be hard because too many days without this energy of the arena, you cool down a little bit, which can be bad.
       
       So it's good that it's not too many free days at the same time. I think for us it's very crucial to go into the first match with the same energy that we absorbed from these matches in Stage 2 and Stage 3, and it's very cool that they had everything on the stage.
       
       With those days to prepare, with the form that you've been in, with the fact that you've had a lot of games to soak up that atmosphere and to work on your form, what are you looking at in the playoffs as your goal or expectation? Do you think you can go all the way and win this one?
       
       I think we should go one by one. We already did something incredible in the Copenhagen Major. We don't think about the win, we just focus on the process, no expectations for sure, but we know how everything works. Four of these players were winning tournaments, team of the year, it just needs to be activated in the proper moment.

       Opponents are very tough obviously, they're in very good shape, like Spirit with donk, or FURIA playing amazing. We always believe, we always believe that there is a chance to beat any team, but either we will do it, or if not, we will try.

       paiN are set to move Franco "⁠dgt⁠" Garcia and David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado to the bench after a period of lackluster results, according to a report by Dust2.com.br.
       
       Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt's troops had a breakthrough top-four result at the Austin Major to go into the summer break full of expectations, but the majority-Brazilian lineup was unable to repeat the success.
       
       paiN made just one semi-final in the second part of the season, at BLAST Rivals Season 2, and most recently exited the Major with a 1-3 record in Stage 3.

       biguzera: "We didn't deserve to go through. We had some very bad games and made some very silly mistakes"
       dav1deuS, who joined the team in January, had an especially tough time in Budapest and averaged a 0.85 rating, a big drop from his 1.02 average across the year, while dgt was paiN's second highest-rated performer in Hungary behind captain biguzera.
       
       With the changes, paiN would be:
       
       Brazil Rodrigo "⁠biguzera⁠" Bittencourt
       Brazil Lucas "⁠nqz⁠" Soares
       Brazil João "⁠snow⁠" Vinicius
       
       Brazil Henrique "⁠rikz⁠" Waku (coach)
       
       Chile David "⁠dav1deuS⁠" Tapia Maldonado (benched)
       Uruguay Franco "⁠dgt⁠" Garcia (benched)
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market is currently entering a high-volatility phase as the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs coincide with seismic roster news, most notably the departure of device and gla1ve from Astralis to 100 Thieves. NAVI assets, specifically w0nderful autographs, represent the strongest growth potential following his elite 1.77 rating and the team’s playoff qualification, while paiN Gaming stickers face immediate devaluation due to roster benchings. Traders should capitalize on the "end-of-era" speculative interest in Astralis stickers before the market shifts focus toward the upcoming 100 Thieves entry in 2026.
       
       **Risk Level:** High
       **Recommendation:** Buy (Selective: NAVI team stickers and device legacy autographs)
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as a 0.12% gain is too marginal to justify selling and would likely result in a net loss after transaction fees.

Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
Sumljiv
10-12-2025 01:20
The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.


The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.

Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.

The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.

Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.

Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.

Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.

Talent of the Year by 1XBET
Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.

Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.

That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.

Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:

United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers

United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell

United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron

Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche

Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill

United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson

United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks

Serbia Janko "⁠YNk⁠" Paunović

Canada Mohan "⁠launders⁠" Govindasamy

Canada Conner "⁠Scrawny⁠" Girvan

United States Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg

United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus


Event of the Year by 1XBET
This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.

There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.

Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:

Poland IEM Katowice 2025

Romania PGL Cluj-Napoca 2025

Kazakhstan PGL Astana 2025

United States BLAST.tv Austin Major

Germany IEM Cologne 2025

Serbia FISSURE Playground 2

Hong Kong BLAST Rivals 2025 Season 2

Hungary StarLadder Budapest Major


Creator of the Year by 1XBET
With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.

Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.

Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

United Kingdom 3kliksphilip

Sweden Anomaly

Spain bysTaXx

Brazil Cachorro1337

Lithuania dima_aimbots

Russia Murzofix

Estonia NadeKing

Georgia shoke

United Kingdom Sparkles

Sweden Virre CS2


Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.

Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

Streamer of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

Ukraine Vadim "⁠Evelone192⁠" Kozakov

United States Erik "⁠fl0m⁠" Flom

Argentina Luciano "⁠forg1⁠" Forgione

Brazil Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta

Germany Mark "⁠ohnePixel⁠" Zimmermann

Russia Ivan "⁠StRoGo⁠" Shurpatov


Skin of the Year by Skin.Club
The newest addition to HLTV Awards, the Skin of the Year is made by starting with all 41 community skins added to the game in 2025.

HLTV then internally voted on the 41 weapon finishes to create this top 10.

Skin of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

AWP | Ice Coaled (REINCARNATION)

AWP | Printstream (JTPNZ)

FAMAS | Bad Trip (HEWOK)

Glock-18 | Shinobu (Horameow)

The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
LucasAM
11-12-2025 00:11
The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.


Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.

Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.

The return of the godfather arc
Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.

Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.


All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.

There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.

The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

The era arc
Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.

The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.


ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.

ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
The redonkulous arc
Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.

zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.

If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.


donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.

Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
The home advantage arc
Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.

The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.


torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.

This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

Jimpphat: "I think it's the time when we all worked our hardest ever"
The redemption arc
"The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.

From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.

One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.


zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.

Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

NiKo: "I would say that we learned our lesson from the Austin Major"
The absolute cinema arc
FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.

Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.


jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.

Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.

Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.

Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

The throwback arc
At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.

That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.


NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
"None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?

The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

The how the fuck arc
Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.

"The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.


The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.

The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.


It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks

       United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus
       
       
       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025
       
       Romania PGL Cluj-Napoca 2025
       
       Kazakhstan PGL Astana 2025

       Hungary StarLadder Budapest Major
       
       
       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.
       
       
       NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a net loss, taking profit is not possible; you should hold for a potential recovery or cut your losses if you anticipate a further decline in value.
15:22:49 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 成功杀入布达佩斯 Major 淘汰赛（八强），作为亚洲赛区的唯一独苗，其关注度和话题性正处于巅峰。今日情绪评分高达 90/100，反映了市场对其“黑马”表现的高度认可。从财务角度看，当前 0.02 的价格处于市场底价，卖出不仅没有利润，还会因交易手续费导致净亏损。考虑到战队即将对阵 Vitality，任何可能的爆冷都将引发印花价格的剧烈拉升；即使失利，底价支撑也使其几乎没有下行风险。建议遵循分析师建议，持有淘汰赛战队资产以博取即时炒作红利。

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks

       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025

       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.
       
       
       NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       B1ad3 on w0nderful: "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments"
       The how the fuck arc
       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as there is currently no profit to realize and the price is already at the market floor.

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks

       United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus
       
       
       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025

       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.
       
       
       NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       The how the fuck arc
       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a minor loss of 1.24%, taking profit is not possible, and cutting losses is likely premature unless your original investment thesis has fundamentally changed.
15:23:14 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Vitality: HOLD, Reason: Vitality 作为本届 Major 的夺冠大热门，已成功杀入八强淘汰赛，即将对阵 The MongolZ。当前 89/100 的高情绪评分反映了市场对其“卫冕冠军”身份及核心选手 ZywOo 冲击历史第三次 Major MVP 的高度期待。财务分析报告建议持有顶级战队资产以博取季后赛动能。虽然目前账面亏损 7.39%，但在淘汰赛高曝光度阶段，任何一场胜利都可能带动价格快速回升。此时割肉不符合专业交易逻辑，应持有以捕捉后续赛段的潜在溢价。

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks
       
       Serbia Janko "⁠YNk⁠" Paunović
       
       Canada Mohan "⁠launders⁠" Govindasamy

       United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus
       
       
       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025
       
       Romania PGL Cluj-Napoca 2025
       
       Kazakhstan PGL Astana 2025

       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.

       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       The how the fuck arc
       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently down 7.39%, taking profit is not an option, and you should consider cutting your loss if you believe the downward trend will continue.

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks
       
       Serbia Janko "⁠YNk⁠" Paunović

       United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus
       
       
       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025

       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.
       
       
       NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       The how the fuck arc
       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as a 0.48% loss is negligible and there is currently no profit to take.

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks
       
       Serbia Janko "⁠YNk⁠" Paunović

       United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus
       
       
       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025

       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.
       
       
       NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       The how the fuck arc
       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a 13.28% loss, there is no profit to take, and you should consider cutting your loss if the asset's downward trend is expected to continue.

       Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year nominees unveiled
       Sumljiv
       10-12-2025 01:20
       The Community Awards return for 2025, 100% decided by HLTV users and presented by 1xBet and Skin.Club.
       
       
       The Community Awards will be decided by HLTV users, with voting set to start on December 16
       The Community Awards are back for 2025's HLTV Awards, featuring five awards to be voted on by you, namely Talent, Event, Creator, Streamer, and Skin of the Year.
       
       Voting will occur in two rounds, with the first happening from December 16 at 19:00  to December 23 at 07:00  in order to reduce the nominees from 10 to three.
       
       The second and final round, which is set to decide the winner of each category, will begin on December 24 at 19:00  and end on December 31 07:00  (Midnight CET) to make sure we get the community's true picks winners and avoid vote splitting.
       
       Voting will only be accessible to HLTV users who have created accounts before the release of this article.
       
       Winners will be announced at the HLTV Awards on January 10 in Belgrade, Serbia.
       
       Now, let's start to list off the nominees — and explain our methodology.
       
       Talent of the Year by 1XBET
       Similar to last year's nominees, this category has been narrowed down with a point-based system.
       
       Each talent member received 2 points for 2+ weeks long S-tier events, and 1 point for all other S-tier events.
       
       That meant that despite aiming for a top 10, a tie between 9th and 12th place means the nominee list will feature all 12.
       
       Talent of the Year nominees, ordered by S-tier event points:
       
       United Kingdom Freya "⁠Freya⁠" Spiers
       
       United Kingdom Harry "⁠JustHarry⁠" Russell
       
       United Kingdom Hugo "⁠Hugo⁠" Byron
       
       Denmark Jacob "⁠Pimp⁠" Winneche
       
       Australia Chad "⁠SPUNJ⁠" Burchill
       
       United Kingdom Alex "⁠Machine⁠" Richardson
       
       United Kingdom James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks
       
       Serbia Janko "⁠YNk⁠" Paunović

       United States Tres "⁠stunna⁠" Saranthus
       
       
       Event of the Year by 1XBET
       This list has been created by limiting nominees to S-tier events and excluding online events, group stages, and tournaments without a live crowd.
       
       There's a maximum of two events per tournament organizer, in which case we look at peak viewers and hours watched divided by airtime using data from Esports Charts to determine the top two from each TO.
       
       Event of the Year nominees, ordered by chronology:
       
       Poland IEM Katowice 2025

       Creator of the Year by 1XBET
       With so many Counter-Strike content creators in the scene, we partnered with Stream Hatchet to identify the top performers using data. Their analysis combines views, engagement, and average watch time throughout 2025 to produce a shortlist of 10 standout nominees.
       
       Creators who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded from consideration.
       
       Creator of the Year nominees, ordered alphabetically:

       Streamer of the Year by 1XBET
       As with the creator category, we worked with Stream Hatchet to gather data on the top Counter-Strike streamers. Their evaluation combines airtime, watch time, peak viewership, and average viewers to produce another shortlist of 10 standout candidates.
       
       Once again, streamers who weren’t primarily focused on Counter-Strike content were excluded.

       The eight arcs of the Budapest Major's cinema bracket
       LucasAM
       11-12-2025 00:11
       The Major playoff bracket is just about as good as it could be and as good as it has ever been. Almost as if it were scripted.
       
       
       Who would have thought that MR12 and three rounds of best-of-ones per stage could give us one of the best Major playoff brackets ever? Yet, here we are, with the top seven teams in the world and a FaZe who surged from the Stage 1 gutter in a cinematic return to form making up one of the most compelling Major playoff brackets ever.
       
       Not only is the playoff bracket a dream, the stories behind the teams left competing are as compelling as can be giving fans even more reason to cheer on their favorites. Here are some of those stories and why each playoff team's run is particularly meaningful in and out of the server.
       
       The return of the godfather arc
       Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's nicknames, namely the professor and the godfather, are a clear indication of how important FURIA's captain is for Brazil. He is the only player still active at the top level from the Luminosity team that rose to prominence in 2015 and won back-to-back Major championships in 2016, and now a wave of nostalgia has taken over fans as the 34-year-old is in prime position to once again stand on top of the world.
       
       Much has changed, of course. The top Brazilian team, FURIA, now actually has two foreigners, Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko and Mareks "⁠YEKINDAR⁠" Gaļinskis, but as the team has gone from strength to strength, winning their last three events and four of the last five they've played, Brazilian fans have warmed up to and welcomed the outside help. A viral video of YEKINDAR singing Ai Se Eu Te Pego with his teammates while FalleN played the accordion no doubt softened hearts and won over even the staunchest opposers of the team's international shift.
       
       
       All of Brazil is standing behind the professor
       The hype in Brazil is at an all time high since the Luminosity/SK days, and that's visible by the 200,000 viewers usually seen following the team's every game at the Major on Alexandre "⁠gAuLeS⁠" Chiqueta's stream, even with it being on a new channel in a new streaming platform.
       
       There's also the story of young molodoy, an obscure Kazakh teenager at the beginning of the year who has become a revelation under FalleN's tutelage. He is now in prime position to become Rookie of the Year having earned two MVP awards during FURIA's rise to the top in the second half of the year.
       
       The fact that any of the other stories are eclipsed by FalleN's return to the top are a testament to his legacy as a player. He is now 34 and his career is winding down, so for any fan who has seen the way he propped up the Brazilian scene through thick and thin, to watch him win another Major nearly a decade later would be to see the cherry put on top of an illustrious career.

       The era arc
       Vitality have been, without a shadow of a doubt, the team of 2025 after capping an incredible first half of the year. The only tournament Vitality didn't win before the summer break was the first one of the season, BLAST Bounty Season 1, which was followed by a seven event winning streak that ended with a Major victory in Austin, where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut also won his seventh consecutive MVP award.
       
       The Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire-led squad put up the most dominant numbers ever seen in a single season, winning 30 straight matches until their best-of-one loss to Legacy in the Austin group stage, and then won 7 more best-of-threes before that streak came to an end at 37.
       
       
       ZywOo is chasing a third Major MVP award
       The second half of the year hasn't been the same as the first, but Vitality haven't been slouches despite appearing so by comparison to their earlier selves, winning an ESL Pro League and reaching two more grand finals and three semi-finals. As they fight to establish an era of their own beyond their dominance in the first half of the year, they have the chance to become the first back-to-back Major champions since Astralis in 2019.
       
       ZywOo, the engine behind much of the team's success this year, is also in a running of his own in Budapest. After becoming the all-time Big Event MVP leader earlier in the year with that seven MVP streak, surpassing Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's 14 to sit alone at the top with 20, ZywOo now has the chance to become the first three-time Major MVP in history, which would put him one step above the only other two-time MVPs, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz.

       flameZ: "We are trying to see every game as an opportunity to do something great"
       The redonkulous arc
       Spirit made two promising signings this year, Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin, who stepped into the shoes of Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia and Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev, but despite the on-paper upgrades to the team's firepower, the new additions haven't quite panned out on the server.
       
       zweih has come under heavy criticism for lacking as the team's anchor, and tN1R's form is a far cry from his breakout with HEROIC at the beginning of the year. Despite that, Spirit are still considered among the favorites in the running, and that's because of Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets.
       
       If donk's 1.73 rating in Stage 3 has taught us anything, it's to never count out Spirit as long as he's on the team. After all, that's the highest-ever rating in a top 16 group stage since best-of-threes were introduced to the Swiss stage. He was also the highest-rated player, with a 1.69 rating, in the Stage 3 Swiss group stage at the Austin Major — the previous record —, but there Spirit were dispatched by MOUZ in the quarter-finals, so of course a great individual record in the group stages isn't everything.
       
       
       donk beat his previous record for highest rating in Stage 3 of a Major with a 1.73 in Budapest
       Still, the 2024 Player of the Year's ability to be a one man army should never be underestimated, as he has breathed new life into a struggling Spirit at the Major. Oh, and to get to the playoffs this time around? donk led the way against MOUZ with a 1.51 rating.
       
       Spirit will need to be at their best, however, as their run in the bracket could be playing on the highest difficulty. They will start off against Falcons, #2 on the VRS and #3 on the HLTV ranking, and if the favorites win their matches, they will face Vitality, #3 on the VRS and #2 on the HLTV ranking, and FURIA, the unanimous #1 on both rankings.

       donk: "I became more mature and now I'm thinking about winning the game as a team, not as a star player"
       The home advantage arc
       Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás isn't the first Hungarian to make it out of the local scene. He wasn't the first to play a Major, or to break out and play at top events. That was Bence "⁠DeadFox⁠" Böröcz with HellRaisers, but torzsi took it one step further when he became the first Hungarian to win Big Event silverware in 2023. That was in his second year with MOUZ after being brought up from the academy team in 2022. In 2024, torzsi became a Top 20 Player of the Year, also a first for a Hungarian player.
       
       The story of MOUZ is one of slow and constant growth. From the seeds planted in the four-peat WePlay Academy League winners in 2021 and 2022, the Hamburg-based organization has nurtured a team that has now won four Big Event trophies since 2023. At first dubbed 'the studio merchants' for winning at events like ESL Pro League, MOUZ have slowly grown and shaken the moniker, reaching two consecutive Major semi-finals in Shanghai and Austin.
       
       
       torzsi is the hometown hero in Budapest
       Still, it's easy to forget that MOUZ are still a very young team. They are, in fact, the joint-youngest with The MongolZ, at 22.6 years old, and while they have enjoyed a modicum of success, the feeling is that they are yet to break through the glass ceiling. They're going up against FaZe in the first round, one of the oldest teams in the playoffs, and the team often used against them contemptiously when they are called budget FaZe.
       
       This event in Hungary, then, means everything to torzsi, who has so far celebrated all of MOUZ's victories stageside during Stage 3 with fans and family. This would be a watershed moment for both torzsi and MOUZ. A first Major victory for a Hungarian, on home soil to boot, and another accolade for MOUZ's grassroots approach to building a around a core of home grown youngsters and allowing them to flourish into a world-class team over time.

       The redemption arc
       "The Falcons project is to have a Major in the next three years," zonic said upon joining the organization in late 2023. Since then, the Dane has been given resources that others could only dream of, and has fallen short time and again. He finally got the pieces he wanted in 2025, but the Austin Major went horribly wrong, so Budapest offers a chance at redemption for one of the most well-regarded coaches in the game.
       
       From failure to failure in the project's early days, the team has grown to becoming a top contender, having won their first tournament at PGL Bucharest and reaching five other finals and four semi-finals this year, which is no small feat. But with the resources at hand, all of those second and third place-finishes just make it feel like they're the first losers.
       
       One of the superteam's centerpieces, Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač, also has his own redemption arc going in Budapest. Not because he has been any worse than he has been during his career or lost any cachet as a player, but because he has the chance to lift a curse that has been plaguing him for the larger part of a decade.
       
       
       zonic and NiKo are both chasing their own redemption arcs in Hungary
       NiKo is in his 16th Major and has made a final twice. He is the most laureated active player to have never won a Major. The first final was in Boston, in 2018, while he was playing with FaZe, a final everyone remembers as one of the biggest upsets in Majors history when Cloud9 made a late-game comeback to claim the trophy and create North America's most cherished Major memory.
       
       Then, in 2021, right as the online era was coming to an end, NiKo and his G2 were in the final in Stockholm against s1mple's Natus Vincere, the hot team of the moment, but the memory that lingers from that night was a missed Desert Eagle sitter by NiKo that could have taken the series to a third map. Instead it ended in overtime of the second map. Every Major since then has been a chance at redemption for NiKo, but so far it hasn't come. Semi-finals in Copenhagen and Shanghai are the closest he has come.

       The absolute cinema arc
       FaZe bullshit has long been acknowledged by Counter-Strike fans. Born as a superteam and housing mavericks since its inception, no team can turn on a dime the way FaZe can, from lackluster early tournament performances to going on a tear and turning the most desperate and tense clutch situations in their favor when it all looks lost.
       
       Recently, some of that identity seemed to be gone forever with one of the organization's stalwarts, Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, leaving after over eight years of service and nearly 2,000 maps with the team, but FaZe are proving that the bullshit lives on.
       
       
       jcobbb has turned his game around at this Major in away that didn't seem possible
       The Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen-led squad struggled in Stage 1 with newcomer Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski still not clicking. The young Pole has been under fire all season long in part because he has to fill the shoes of a club legend whose removal was unpopular with fans, and in part because he did not step up immediately and struggled to instantly adapt to top tier play.
       
       Players like donk, molodoy, and Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin have recently come from relative obscurity to shining on big stages, but that's not the normal progression of a rookie, and a term has even been coined for people who expect too much too soon from rookies: The donk delusion.
       
       Miraculously, however, jcobbb went from posting a 0.87 rating in Stage 1 to 1.24 and 1.25 ratings in Stages 2 and 3. Talk about some bullshit. Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants, too, who has come under fire this year and was removed from the team before being brought back, went from 0.96 in Stage 1 to 1.01 in Stage 2 to 1.19 in Stage 3.
       
       Going from being 0.4 seconds away from Stage 1 elimination to winning a Major would be FaZe's biggest bullshit to date.

       The throwback arc
       At first this seemed to me one of the weakest arcs, but Natus Vincere are very close to where they were the last time they won a Major. Not really on anyone's radar, that is. The last time they won a Major, right after going international, they did so despite losing more rounds than they won, and are the only team to ever win a Major with that statistic.
       
       That victory really did come out of left field, but also left an indelible image of captain Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen jumping on the table after winning, taking his jersey off and pointing at himself. No doubt vindication for all of the times people had said he was failing upwards. A photograph posted on X kissing the trophy with the caption "I might be him" followed.
       
       
       NAVI were also underdogs when they pulled off their Major-winning run in Copenhagen
       "None of this would have been possible without the teammates I have. So selfless, everybody doing tons of work. For the past six months, we've had ups and downs. Everybody worked their ass off," is what the Finn said after the match. Under Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy's system, that seems to now be the Natus Vincere way. Could they be somewhere similar at this Major?
       
       The changes this time around aren't as big as they were before Copenhagen. There hasn't been a major transition like the one Natus Vincere underwent when going international. But there is a rookie now with potential and Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov appears to be transformed to the point that B1ad3 acknowledged it as an X factor. From the 1.14, 1.13, and 1.15 ratings of Majors past, the AWPer now posted a 1.77 in Stage 2 and 1.30 in Stage 3. "With this performance, I think you can win tournaments," the team's coach told HLTV.

       The how the fuck arc
       Milan "⁠Striker⁠" Švejda renamed it 'The stand-in with the devil's deal arc' in the HLTV Newsletter, which served as inspiration for this piece and which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this article if you haven't yet, but his working title of The how the fuck arc just captured my imagination in a way that nothing else really can.
       
       "The overperformance relative to expectations is insane, one of the biggest ever," is the succinct way Zvonimir "⁠Professeur⁠" Burazin described Unudelger "⁠controlez⁠" Baasanjargal's time as a stand-in for The MongolZ at the Major in the latest HLTV Confirmed podcast, and I don't think I could say it in any better.
       
       
       The MongolZ will face Vitality in the quarter-finals
       The MongolZ, always shrouded in mystery — at least to Western audiences —, benched their best player right before the Major and somehow still looked really strong with a 3-1 record in Stage 3. Noted, they will be playing a whole new level of team in the playoffs, but they have so far quieted the doubters.
       
       The truly baffling part of the puzzle, however, is that a 28-year-old who never particularly stood out even at the regional level gets brought in and drops a 1.23 rating at Stage 3 of the Major. Such a performance really defies the odds, but it does go to show that The MongolZ knew exactly what they needed and where to find it, even if nobody else could expect it.
       
       
       It's hard to imagine The MongolZ doing better without Azbayar "⁠Senzu⁠" Munkhbold than with him, and their best at a Major was reaching the final in Austin before falling to the invincible Vitality of the first half of the year. Then again, it's just as hard to imagine controlez doing what he has been doing so far. Poetically, Mongolia's finest will meet none other than their Austin butchers, Vitality, in the first round of the playoffs.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market risk level is currently **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile playoff stage compounded by the upcoming HLTV Community Awards speculative cycle. I recommend a **Selective Buy** on Spirit (donk) and FURIA (FalleN) stickers, capitalizing on record-breaking individual ratings and the high-volume Brazilian "Godfather" narrative. Additionally, investors should **Hold** "Skin of the Year" nominees like the AWP Printstream and Ice Coaled, as the December 16th voting launch is expected to trigger a short-term price pump.

ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
Nohte
11-12-2025 01:02
The British coach says he needs a break to clear his head and work on himself.


Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye has stepped down from his coaching duties at GamerLegion and will be taking a break due to personal reasons, it has been announced.

"I need a break to clear my head and work on myself and then I'll be back," ash said when contacted by HLTV. "Hopefully sooner than later."

In a video explaining the decision, the 35-year-old cited burnout as the main factor behind the change.

"I've really struggled mentally for the second half of the year," ash said. "The schedule has been brutal in terms of traveling and the lack of recovery time, and I first noticed that something wasn't right at IEM Dallas when we had acoR as a stand-in.

"My body language felt uncontrollably bad against Falcons in the playoffs. We weren't expected to win that game at all, and I felt extremely badly affected during it. It should have been a really, really high moment in my career, but it felt completely the opposite during the game."

The Brit added that he hoped that the summer tournament break would help refresh him, but it only did so partially as his sleep and body language continued to get worse, and he grew increasingly frustrated at team mistakes.

I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally
Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye
ash has stood behind GamerLegion for nearly five years and notably guided the organization to the grand final of the BLAST.tv Paris Major. He also played a key role in rebuilding the roster time and time again into a top 20 contender with his scouting and player development, but hit a roadblock in 2025 as the team struggled with fitting an AWPer into its system.

"I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally," ash said. "sl3nd was struggling and I couldn't fix it, then Kursy was having a hard time dealing with the pressure which I desperately wanted to help him with, but I wasn't able to do so.

"Then when hypex comes in, we get off to a great start at Pro League by going and playing the best three teams in the world in the Swiss stage and going 0-3. It just mounted the pressure more."

ash acknowledged how much of a privilege it is to work in Counter-Strike and said he has been living his dream, but said he's pushed himself too hard for too long without consistent breaks, making himself "too results-dependent."

All of that has compounded into him taking a break, during which he says he is working with GamerLegion's sports psychologist and another person away from Counter-Strike.

ash's departure from the active lineup comes on the heels of GamerLegion's disastrous 1-3 exit from Stage 1 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they recorded a solitary best-of-three win against Rare Atom around losses to Fluxo, RED Canids, and PARIVISION.

The change also comes heading into an uncertain off-season for the GamerLegion core, which was previously linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves. The North American organization has already signed Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard as its in-game leader and has been linked with the addition of Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz from Astralis and Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander as coach.

Valve bans skins gambling, case opening sites from jerseys and events in TOR

The change forbids Licensees from distributing or displaying any content or material that violates Valve's IP or the Steam Subscriber Agreement.


Two days ago, Valve updated the Tournament Operation Requirements (TOR) and amended its Limited Game Tournament License which restricts how companies can use Valve's IP.

The changes, first highlighted by Dust2.us, forces both Unranked and Ranked events to abide by section 2.4.e of the Limited Games Tournament License, which forbids Licensees from distributing or displaying, including on team jerseys, any content or material that violates Valve's IP or the Steam Subscriber Agreement.

Examples given include "game case opening sites or skin trading sites," and restrictions apply to any content that is broadcast of the tournament, meaning teams must not display those sponsors on their jerseys.

The impact on the ecosystem is yet to be seen as several top teams have existing sponsorship deals with skin sites, as do smaller organizations and tournament organizers.

Some organizations had already swapped out their jerseys for non-sponsored variants ahead of arriving in Budapest.

Limited Game Tournament License, Section 2.4.e:
IP Protection. Licensee must not distribute or display, including on team jerseys or in any other content that may be visible during the broadcast, any content or material that either violates Valve IP or the terms of the Steam Subscriber Agreement (for example, game case opening sites or skin trading sites). Licensee shall not permit any content that violates Valve IP or the terms of the Steam Subscriber Agreement (e.g., logos on player jerseys) to appear in any broadcasts of the Tournament. Licensee will not accept sponsorships from sponsors that generate revenue through activities that violate applicable Valve agreements or violate local law or rely on Valve's game economies. This includes, but is not limited to, key resellers or companies that interact with players' Valve game inventories.

The Ninjas are looking for a new fifth as they look to build on 2025.


Michel "⁠ewjerkz⁠" Pinto has been moved to Ninjas in Pyjamas's bench, confirming an earlier report by RTP Arena.

The 25-year-old joined the Ninjas alongside compatriot Rafael "⁠arrozdoce⁠" Wing for this year, but SAW's old star duo struggled to click into gear in an international environment.

Roles were also a problem for ewjerkz, who was asked to be a star player in the first half of 2025 in aggressive, spacetaking, positions without putting up the numbers to match.

After the arrival of Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara, ewjerkz accepted that he would lose some of those roles, saying he would prefer "more action" in an ideal world but acknowledging his performances had fallen short.

At the end of 2025, ewjerkz has averaged a 1.08 rating, falling to 1.00 in the last three months.

As we await confirmation of their fifth, Ninjas in Pyjamas are also yet to announce whether xKacpersky's addition on loan from ENCE will be made permanent, or if it will expire any time soon.

15:24:30 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:24:30 | INFO     | The market is currently facing **High** systemic risk following Valve’s aggressive regulatory update to Tournament Operation Requirements, which targets the primary liquidity providers (skin trading and gambling sites) and threatens the ecosystem's financial backbone. While roster instability in organizations like GamerLegion and NIP creates localized volatility for their specific stickers, the broader threat of a "panic sell" looms as investors fear further crackdowns on trade bots and inventory-linked platforms. 

**Recommendation: Sell** high-liquidity investments to realize gains before potential volume drops, or **Hold** rare, legacy assets while strictly avoiding new entries until the market stabilizes from these policy shifts.

       The market is currently facing **High** systemic risk following Valve’s aggressive regulatory update to Tournament Operation Requirements, which targets the primary liquidity providers (skin trading and gambling sites) and threatens the ecosystem's financial backbone. While roster instability in organizations like GamerLegion and NIP creates localized volatility for their specific stickers, the broader threat of a "panic sell" looms as investors fear further crackdowns on trade bots and inventory-linked platforms. 
       
       **Recommendation: Sell** high-liquidity investments to realize gains before potential volume drops, or **Hold** rare, legacy assets while strictly avoiding new entries until the market stabilizes from these policy shifts.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With the asset down 4.60%, there is no profit to take, and you should consider cutting your losses if you anticipate a further decline in value.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout

       11-12-2025 01:02
       The British coach says he needs a break to clear his head and work on himself.
       
       
       Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye has stepped down from his coaching duties at GamerLegion and will be taking a break due to personal reasons, it has been announced.
       
       "I need a break to clear my head and work on myself and then I'll be back," ash said when contacted by HLTV. "Hopefully sooner than later."
       
       In a video explaining the decision, the 35-year-old cited burnout as the main factor behind the change.
       
       "I've really struggled mentally for the second half of the year," ash said. "The schedule has been brutal in terms of traveling and the lack of recovery time, and I first noticed that something wasn't right at IEM Dallas when we had acoR as a stand-in.
       
       "My body language felt uncontrollably bad against Falcons in the playoffs. We weren't expected to win that game at all, and I felt extremely badly affected during it. It should have been a really, really high moment in my career, but it felt completely the opposite during the game."
       
       The Brit added that he hoped that the summer tournament break would help refresh him, but it only did so partially as his sleep and body language continued to get worse, and he grew increasingly frustrated at team mistakes.
       
       I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally
       Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye
       ash has stood behind GamerLegion for nearly five years and notably guided the organization to the grand final of the BLAST.tv Paris Major. He also played a key role in rebuilding the roster time and time again into a top 20 contender with his scouting and player development, but hit a roadblock in 2025 as the team struggled with fitting an AWPer into its system.
       
       "I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally," ash said. "sl3nd was struggling and I couldn't fix it, then Kursy was having a hard time dealing with the pressure which I desperately wanted to help him with, but I wasn't able to do so.
       
       "Then when hypex comes in, we get off to a great start at Pro League by going and playing the best three teams in the world in the Swiss stage and going 0-3. It just mounted the pressure more."
       
       ash acknowledged how much of a privilege it is to work in Counter-Strike and said he has been living his dream, but said he's pushed himself too hard for too long without consistent breaks, making himself "too results-dependent."
       
       All of that has compounded into him taking a break, during which he says he is working with GamerLegion's sports psychologist and another person away from Counter-Strike.
       
       ash's departure from the active lineup comes on the heels of GamerLegion's disastrous 1-3 exit from Stage 1 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they recorded a solitary best-of-three win against Rare Atom around losses to Fluxo, RED Canids, and PARIVISION.
       
       The change also comes heading into an uncertain off-season for the GamerLegion core, which was previously linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves. The North American organization has already signed Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard as its in-game leader and has been linked with the addition of Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz from Astralis and Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander as coach.

       Two days ago, Valve updated the Tournament Operation Requirements (TOR) and amended its Limited Game Tournament License which restricts how companies can use Valve's IP.
       
       The changes, first highlighted by Dust2.us, forces both Unranked and Ranked events to abide by section 2.4.e of the Limited Games Tournament License, which forbids Licensees from distributing or displaying, including on team jerseys, any content or material that violates Valve's IP or the Steam Subscriber Agreement.
       
       Examples given include "game case opening sites or skin trading sites," and restrictions apply to any content that is broadcast of the tournament, meaning teams must not display those sponsors on their jerseys.
       
       The impact on the ecosystem is yet to be seen as several top teams have existing sponsorship deals with skin sites, as do smaller organizations and tournament organizers.
       
       Some organizations had already swapped out their jerseys for non-sponsored variants ahead of arriving in Budapest.

Licensee will not accept sponsorships from sponsors that generate revenue through activities that violate applicable Valve agreements or violate local law or rely on Valve's game economies.

       The market is currently facing **High** systemic risk following Valve’s aggressive regulatory update to Tournament Operation Requirements, which targets the primary liquidity providers (skin trading and gambling sites) and threatens the ecosystem's financial backbone.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       Nohte
       11-12-2025 01:02
       The British coach says he needs a break to clear his head and work on himself.
       
       
       Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye has stepped down from his coaching duties at GamerLegion and will be taking a break due to personal reasons, it has been announced.
       
       "I need a break to clear my head and work on myself and then I'll be back," ash said when contacted by HLTV. "Hopefully sooner than later."
       
       In a video explaining the decision, the 35-year-old cited burnout as the main factor behind the change.
       
       "I've really struggled mentally for the second half of the year," ash said. "The schedule has been brutal in terms of traveling and the lack of recovery time, and I first noticed that something wasn't right at IEM Dallas when we had acoR as a stand-in.
       
       "My body language felt uncontrollably bad against Falcons in the playoffs. We weren't expected to win that game at all, and I felt extremely badly affected during it. It should have been a really, really high moment in my career, but it felt completely the opposite during the game."
       
       The Brit added that he hoped that the summer tournament break would help refresh him, but it only did so partially as his sleep and body language continued to get worse, and he grew increasingly frustrated at team mistakes.
       
       I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally
       Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye
       ash has stood behind GamerLegion for nearly five years and notably guided the organization to the grand final of the BLAST.tv Paris Major. He also played a key role in rebuilding the roster time and time again into a top 20 contender with his scouting and player development, but hit a roadblock in 2025 as the team struggled with fitting an AWPer into its system.
       
       "I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally," ash said. "sl3nd was struggling and I couldn't fix it, then Kursy was having a hard time dealing with the pressure which I desperately wanted to help him with, but I wasn't able to do so.
       
       "Then when hypex comes in, we get off to a great start at Pro League by going and playing the best three teams in the world in the Swiss stage and going 0-3. It just mounted the pressure more."
       
       ash acknowledged how much of a privilege it is to work in Counter-Strike and said he has been living his dream, but said he's pushed himself too hard for too long without consistent breaks, making himself "too results-dependent."
       
       All of that has compounded into him taking a break, during which he says he is working with GamerLegion's sports psychologist and another person away from Counter-Strike.
       
       ash's departure from the active lineup comes on the heels of GamerLegion's disastrous 1-3 exit from Stage 1 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they recorded a solitary best-of-three win against Rare Atom around losses to Fluxo, RED Canids, and PARIVISION.
       
       The change also comes heading into an uncertain off-season for the GamerLegion core, which was previously linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves. The North American organization has already signed Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard as its in-game leader and has been linked with the addition of Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz from Astralis and Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander as coach.

He also played a key role in rebuilding the roster time and time again into a top 20 contender with his scouting and player development, but hit a roadblock in 2025 as the team struggled with fitting an AWPer into its system.
       
       "I started letting moments outside of my control affect me mentally, and I was taking the results personally," ash said. "sl3nd was struggling and I couldn't fix it, then Kursy was having a hard time dealing with the pressure which I desperately wanted to help him with, but I wasn't able to do so.
       
       "Then when hypex comes in, we get off to a great start at Pro League by going and playing the best three teams in the world in the Swiss stage and going 0-3. It just mounted the pressure more."
       
       ash acknowledged how much of a privilege it is to work in Counter-Strike and said he has been living his dream, but said he's pushed himself too hard for too long without consistent breaks, making himself "too results-dependent."
       
       All of that has compounded into him taking a break, during which he says he is working with GamerLegion's sports psychologist and another person away from Counter-Strike.
       
       ash's departure from the active lineup comes on the heels of GamerLegion's disastrous 1-3 exit from Stage 1 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they recorded a solitary best-of-three win against Rare Atom around losses to Fluxo, RED Canids, and PARIVISION.
       
       The change also comes heading into an uncertain off-season for the GamerLegion core, which was previously linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves. The North American organization has already signed Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard as its in-game leader and has been linked with the addition of Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz from Astralis and Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander as coach.

       The market is currently facing **High** systemic risk following Valve’s aggressive regulatory update to Tournament Operation Requirements, which targets the primary liquidity providers (skin trading and gambling sites) and threatens the ecosystem's financial backbone. While roster instability in organizations like GamerLegion and NIP creates localized volatility for their specific stickers, the broader threat of a "panic sell" looms as investors fear further crackdowns on trade bots and inventory-linked platforms.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout

       The British coach says he needs a break to clear his head and work on himself.
       
       
       Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye has stepped down from his coaching duties at GamerLegion and will be taking a break due to personal reasons, it has been announced.
       
       "I need a break to clear my head and work on myself and then I'll be back," ash said when contacted by HLTV. "Hopefully sooner than later."
       
       In a video explaining the decision, the 35-year-old cited burnout as the main factor behind the change.
       
       "I've really struggled mentally for the second half of the year," ash said. "The schedule has been brutal in terms of traveling and the lack of recovery time, and I first noticed that something wasn't right at IEM Dallas when we had acoR as a stand-in.
       
       "My body language felt uncontrollably bad against Falcons in the playoffs. We weren't expected to win that game at all, and I felt extremely badly affected during it. It should have been a really, really high moment in my career, but it felt completely the opposite during the game."
       
       The Brit added that he hoped that the summer tournament break would help refresh him, but it only did so partially as his sleep and body language continued to get worse, and he grew increasingly frustrated at team mistakes.

zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
Striker
12-12-2025 02:05
In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.


Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.

Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.

In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.



"I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."

A curse is lifted
Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.

After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.

Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.

He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.

Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.

While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.

The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.


m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.

"There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.


Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.

Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.

The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

During his second Astralis tenure, the team notably reached the playoffs at FISSURE Playground 2 and IEM Chengdu.

According to Dust2.dk's sources, it is unlikely that stavn will return to the starting roster at the end of the year.

The Danish organization is currently in the market for a new AWPer to replace device, who is set to reunite with his former teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander in 100 Thieves' new project. gla1ve recently announced his retirement as a player and transition to coaching.


ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026

The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.


IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.

IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.

"IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."

The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.

The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."


Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.

This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.

GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.

Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.

"We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       Sources: Magisk set to leave Astralis
       MIRAA
       12-12-2025 18:38
       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       According to Dust2.dk's sources, it is unlikely that stavn will return to the starting roster at the end of the year.
       
       The Danish organization is currently in the market for a new AWPer to replace device, who is set to reunite with his former teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander in 100 Thieves' new project. gla1ve recently announced his retirement as a player and transition to coaching.
       
       
       ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026
       LucasAM
       12-12-2025 21:11
       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.

       The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."
       
       
       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is not an option, and you should only cut your loss if you anticipate a further decline in the asset's value.
15:28:32 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 虽然在四分之一决赛中以 0-2 负于 Vitality 止步八强，导致短期赛事炒作热度有所回落，但当前 0.02 的价格已处于市场底价（Floor Price），几乎没有进一步下行的空间。考虑到交易平台的手续费损耗，此时平价卖出必然导致实际亏损。鉴于战队在本次 Major 的出色表现，以及 2026 年新加坡 Major 官宣对亚洲市场的长期潜在利好，该印花在低价位具有较强的抗跌性和收藏价值。在风险极低且‘卖出即亏’的情况下，建议继续持有观望。

       zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
       Striker
       12-12-2025 02:05
       In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.
       
       
       Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.
       
       Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.
       
       In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.
       
       
       
       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       Sources: Magisk set to leave Astralis
       MIRAA
       12-12-2025 18:38
       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       According to Dust2.dk's sources, it is unlikely that stavn will return to the starting roster at the end of the year.
       
       The Danish organization is currently in the market for a new AWPer to replace device, who is set to reunite with his former teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander in 100 Thieves' new project. gla1ve recently announced his retirement as a player and transition to coaching.
       
       
       ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026
       LucasAM
       12-12-2025 21:11
       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.

       The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."
       
       
       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are at break-even and the price is at a market floor, it is best to hold because selling now would result in a net loss after transaction fees.
15:28:54 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: HOLD, Reason: Spirit 刚刚以 2-0 横扫 Falcons 晋级布达佩斯 Major 四强，核心选手 donk 持续打出统治级表现（目前锦标赛平均 rating 1.67），且队伍成功打破了对阵 NiKo/m0NESY 组合的长期“魔咒”。今日情绪评分高达 94/100，反映了市场对 Spirit 夺冠极高的期待。财务分析报告明确建议持有 Spirit 以博取半决赛及决赛的热度动量。尽管目前账面亏损 12.08%，但在战队竞技状态火热、即将迎来与 Vitality 的“巅峰对决”这一重大利好催化剂面前，此时割肉将错过潜在的价格爆发期。

       zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
       Striker
       12-12-2025 02:05
       In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.
       
       
       Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.
       
       Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.
       
       In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.
       
       
       
       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       Sources: Magisk set to leave Astralis
       MIRAA

       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       During his second Astralis tenure, the team notably reached the playoffs at FISSURE Playground 2 and IEM Chengdu.
       
       According to Dust2.dk's sources, it is unlikely that stavn will return to the starting roster at the end of the year.
       
       The Danish organization is currently in the market for a new AWPer to replace device, who is set to reunite with his former teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander in 100 Thieves' new project. gla1ve recently announced his retirement as a player and transition to coaching.
       
       
       ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026
       LucasAM
       12-12-2025 21:11
       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.

       The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."
       
       
       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, you cannot take profit and should consider cutting your losses to prevent further capital erosion if the asset's outlook remains negative.
15:29:06 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Vitality: HOLD, Reason: Vitality 刚刚以 2-0 轻松击败 The MongolZ 晋级布达佩斯 Major 四强，核心选手 ZywOo 打出了惊人的 2.18 rating，展现了统治级的竞技状态。今日情绪评分高达 95/100，反映出市场对其卫冕及冲击 MVP 的极高期待。财务分析报告明确建议持有 Vitality 以博取决赛前的热度红利。尽管目前账面亏损 8.70%，但在半决赛即将迎来与 Spirit 的“世纪大战”这一重大利好催化剂面前，此时离场将错过潜在的价格修复和爆发期。建议继续持有，锁定季后赛高曝光红利。

       zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
       Striker
       12-12-2025 02:05
       In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.
       
       
       Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.
       
       Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.
       
       In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.
       
       
       
       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       Sources: Magisk set to leave Astralis
       MIRAA
       12-12-2025 18:38
       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.

       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently down 8.70%, there are no profits to take, so you should evaluate your risk tolerance to decide whether to cut your loss now or hold for a potential recovery.
15:29:18 | INFO     |     -> Decision for ZywOo: HOLD, Reason: ZywOo 在布达佩斯 Major 四分之一决赛中打出了惊人的 2.18 rating，展现了统治级的竞技状态，并打破了多项赛事纪录。今日情绪评分高达 98/100，反映出市场对这位顶级巨星冲击历史第三个 Major MVP 的极度狂热。财务分析报告明确建议持有 ZywOo 等顶级蓝筹选手印花，以博取半决赛及决赛期间的热度红利。目前仅有 1.87% 的极小浮亏，在战队竞技状态火热且即将迎来与 Spirit (donk) 的“巅峰对决”前，持有是捕捉潜在爆发性溢价的最优策略。

       zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
       Striker
       12-12-2025 02:05
       In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.
       
       
       Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.
       
       Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.
       
       In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.
       
       
       
       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       Sources: Magisk set to leave Astralis
       MIRAA
       12-12-2025 18:38
       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026

       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.
       
       
       GamerLegion bench ztr

       The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."
       
       
       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With a negligible loss of only 1.87%, it is better to hold this high-tier asset through minor market volatility rather than cutting losses prematurely.
15:29:30 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: rain 作为 100 Thieves 官方确认的首位核心成员，其印花价值目前正处于品牌复兴的强力炒作期。今日新闻进一步确认 device 预计加盟 100T 组建“银河战舰”，这一持续的重磅利好为 rain 的印花提供了极强的基本面支撑。虽然目前账面亏损 13.28%，但 85/100 的高情绪评分显示市场对其加盟后的前景极度看好。财务分析报告也建议在此期间关注 100T 相关的投机机会。在品牌复苏红利尚未完全释放、阵容官宣仍有后续动作的背景下，持有是捕捉潜在价格修复和爆发的最优策略。

       zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
       Striker
       12-12-2025 02:05
       In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.
       
       
       Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.
       
       Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.
       
       In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.
       
       
       
       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026
       LucasAM
       12-12-2025 21:11
       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.
       
       
       GamerLegion bench ztr

       12-12-2025 22:10
       The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."
       
       
       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is not an option; you should consider cutting your loss to prevent further downside or holding if you expect a recovery.

       zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis
       Striker
       12-12-2025 02:05
       In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.
       
       
       Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.
       
       Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.
       
       In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.
       
       
       
       "I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."
       
       A curse is lifted
       Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.
       
       After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.
       
       Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.
       
       He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.
       
       Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
       For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.
       
       While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.
       
       The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.
       
       
       m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
       For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.
       
       "There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

       Sources: Magisk set to leave Astralis

       The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.
       
       
       Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
       Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.
       
       Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.
       
       The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

       According to Dust2.dk's sources, it is unlikely that stavn will return to the starting roster at the end of the year.
       
       The Danish organization is currently in the market for a new AWPer to replace device, who is set to reunite with his former teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander in 100 Thieves' new project. gla1ve recently announced his retirement as a player and transition to coaching.
       
       
       ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026
       LucasAM
       12-12-2025 21:11
       The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.
       
       
       IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
       IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.
       
       IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.
       
       "IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."
       
       The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.
       
       
       GamerLegion bench ztr

       The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."
       
       
       Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.
       
       This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.
       
       GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.
       
       Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.
       
       "We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market currently faces moderate-to-high volatility as the Budapest Major enters its final stages, compounded by significant "Silly Season" speculation regarding the dissolution of the Astralis core and the emergence of the 100 Thieves project. **HOLD** Spirit and Vitality stickers as donk and ZywOo’s record-breaking performances drive short-term demand toward the finals, while **SELL** Falcons and GamerLegion assets following their disappointing exits and impending roster overhauls. Speculative **BUYING** of device-related items is advised as his move to 100 Thieves creates a major narrative catalyst for 2026.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as a 0.25% gain is too marginal to cover typical transaction fees and suggests the price is currently stagnant.

NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
NER0cs
13-12-2025 06:35
Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.


FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.

It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.

Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.


Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake

But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.

As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.

It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.


Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno

On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.

Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.

But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.

And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.

After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.

molodoy's luck runs dry

For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.

And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.

In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.

On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.

The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright





Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.

This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.

If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

"[B1ad3] said after the map, 'forget this map,'" iM told James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks on stage post-game. "'Just play Train like nothing happened.' It doesn't matter that we won Mirage, that we lost Inferno, that we lost clutches, or whatever. Even after that 1v3, I didn't hear anything in TeamSpeak that was like we were tilted. We were trying to say, focus up, it doesn't matter."

And as fate would have it, it's Copenhagen's Major finalist FaZe who are next in Natus Vincere's path.

Snax returns to GamerLegion

13-12-2025 19:34
The Pole is back for a second stint in the organization.


GamerLegion have announced the return of Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski, with the Polish IGL set to take the place of the recently benched Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson.

The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves.

ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2.

At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL.

The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.

       NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
       NER0cs
       13-12-2025 06:35
       Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.
       
       
       FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.
       
       It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.
       
       Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.
       
       
       Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake
       
       But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.
       
       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       The unexpected elimination of world #1 FURIA by a resurgent Natus Vincere has triggered a sharp correction for "molodoy" speculative assets while driving high-volume demand for NAVI team stickers and "makazze" breakout signatures. Risk level is **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile "bubble" phase where performance-based hype is rapidly shifting from established favorites to underdog contenders like FaZe and NAVI. **HOLD** NAVI positions to capitalize on the momentum of their upcoming semi-final, but **SELL** FURIA and "molodoy" stickers immediately to mitigate further losses following their premature exit.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at a 5.18% loss, there is no profit to take, and you should consider cutting your loss if you believe the downward trend will continue.
15:30:36 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: The MongolZ 虽然已在淘汰赛中出局，但目前 0.02 的价格已是此类印花的市场底价。财务分析报告指出，随着 FURIA 等夺冠热门被爆冷淘汰，市场资金正在剧烈波动并寻找新的避风港。考虑到饰品交易平台的手续费成本，此时平价卖出必然导致净亏损。鉴于战队在本次 Major 的出色表现已为其积累了较高的品牌认可度，且价格已无下行空间，持有以等待市场整体流动性回暖或长期收藏价值体现是更稳健的选择。

       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
       NER0cs
       13-12-2025 06:35
       Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.
       
       
       FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.
       
       It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.
       
       Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.
       
       
       Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake
       
       But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.
       
       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       The Pole is back for a second stint in the organization.
       
       
       GamerLegion have announced the return of Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski, with the Polish IGL set to take the place of the recently benched Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson.
       
       The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves.

       This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2.
       
       At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL.
       
       The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The unexpected elimination of world #1 FURIA by a resurgent Natus Vincere has triggered a sharp correction for "molodoy" speculative assets while driving high-volume demand for NAVI team stickers and "makazze" breakout signatures. Risk level is **High**, as the Budapest Major enters a volatile "bubble" phase where performance-based hype is rapidly shifting from established favorites to underdog contenders like FaZe and NAVI. **HOLD** NAVI positions to capitalize on the momentum of their upcoming semi-final, but **SELL** FURIA and "molodoy" stickers immediately to mitigate further losses following their premature exit.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With the asset currently down 8.87%, there is no profit to take, so you should consider cutting your loss if the price continues to decline.

NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
NER0cs
13-12-2025 06:35
Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.


FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.

It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.

Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.


Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake

But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.

As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.

It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.


Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno

On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.

Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.

But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.

And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.

After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.

molodoy's luck runs dry

For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.

And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.

In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.

On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.

The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright





Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.

This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.

If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

"[B1ad3] said after the map, 'forget this map,'" iM told James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks on stage post-game. "'Just play Train like nothing happened.' It doesn't matter that we won Mirage, that we lost Inferno, that we lost clutches, or whatever. Even after that 1v3, I didn't hear anything in TeamSpeak that was like we were tilted. We were trying to say, focus up, it doesn't matter."

And as fate would have it, it's Copenhagen's Major finalist FaZe who are next in Natus Vincere's path.

GamerLegion have announced the return of Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski, with the Polish IGL set to take the place of the recently benched Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson.

The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves.

ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2.

At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL.

The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.

GamerLegion are currently:

Denmark Sebastian "⁠Tauson⁠" Tauson Lindelof
Czech Republic Oldřich "⁠PR⁠" Nový
Sweden Fredrik "⁠REZ⁠" Sterner
Poland Milan "⁠hypex⁠" Polowiec
Poland Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski

France Jeremy "⁠Kursy⁠" Gast (benched)
Sweden Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson (benched)
United Kingdom Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye (inactive)

16:08:40 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16:08:40 | INFO     | The elimination of world #1 FURIA and the underperformance of star rookie molodoy have triggered a sharp devaluation of FURIA assets, while NAVI’s upset victory has created a high-momentum "bull run" for their stickers, specifically for breakout rookie makazze. Risk is currently **High** due to extreme volatility and the collapse of the tournament's favorite-led price brackets, leaving the market in a speculative state ahead of the NAVI vs. FaZe semi-final. My recommendation is to **Buy** NAVI and makazze stickers to capitalize on the "Copenhagen underdog" narrative, while **Selling** FURIA positions immediately to avoid further losses following their premature exit.

       NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
       NER0cs
       13-12-2025 06:35
       Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.
       
       
       FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.
       
       It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.
       
       Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.
       
       
       Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake
       
       But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.
       
       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       Since the asset is currently at a 5.18% loss, you should consider cutting your loss if you anticipate further decline, as taking profit is not currently possible.

       The elimination of world #1 FURIA and the underperformance of star rookie molodoy have triggered a sharp devaluation of FURIA assets, while NAVI’s upset victory has created a high-momentum "bull run" for their stickers, specifically for breakout rookie makazze. Risk is currently **High** due to extreme volatility and the collapse of the tournament's favorite-led price brackets, leaving the market in a speculative state ahead of the NAVI vs. FaZe semi-final. My recommendation is to **Buy** NAVI and makazze stickers to capitalize on the "Copenhagen underdog" narrative, while **Selling** FURIA positions immediately to avoid further losses following their premature exit.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With zero price movement, it is best to hold as there is currently no profit to realize and no loss to mitigate.
16:09:44 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Spirit: SELL, Reason: 该印花在持仓23天内已累计下跌20.96%，技术面上表现出明显的下行趋势。根据最新的市场新闻，资金正在大规模流向由于爆冷获胜而产生极高热度的 NAVI 和 makazze 印花，同时 100 Thieves 的回归传闻也吸引了大量投机资金。Spirit 在当前的新闻周期中缺乏利好支撑，处于被市场忽视的边缘。在当前 55/100 的平庸情绪下，继续持有将面临更高的机会成本和进一步阴跌的风险。作为专业交易员，应当果断止损，将仓位调整至更具动能的资产（如 NAVI 相关）以寻求回本。

       NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
       NER0cs
       13-12-2025 06:35
       Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.
       
       
       FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.
       
       It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.
       
       Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.
       
       
       Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake
       
       But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.
       
       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       "[B1ad3] said after the map, 'forget this map,'" iM told James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks on stage post-game. "'Just play Train like nothing happened.' It doesn't matter that we won Mirage, that we lost Inferno, that we lost clutches, or whatever. Even after that 1v3, I didn't hear anything in TeamSpeak that was like we were tilted. We were trying to say, focus up, it doesn't matter."
       
       And as fate would have it, it's Copenhagen's Major finalist FaZe who are next in Natus Vincere's path.

       Since you are currently at a significant loss of nearly 21%, there is no profit to take, and you should consider cutting your losses if the asset's fundamentals do not suggest a clear path to recovery.

It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       The elimination of world #1 FURIA and the underperformance of star rookie molodoy have triggered a sharp devaluation of FURIA assets, while NAVI’s upset victory has created a high-momentum "bull run" for their stickers, specifically for breakout rookie makazze. Risk is currently **High** due to extreme volatility and the collapse of the tournament's favorite-led price brackets, leaving the market in a speculative state ahead of the NAVI vs. FaZe semi-final. My recommendation is to **Buy** NAVI and makazze stickers to capitalize on the "Copenhagen underdog" narrative, while **Selling** FURIA positions immediately to avoid further losses following their premature exit.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at an 8.87% loss, there is no profit to realize, and you should consider cutting your loss if the asset hits your risk tolerance limit or fails to hold key support levels.

       NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
       NER0cs
       13-12-2025 06:35
       Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.
       
       
       FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.
       
       It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.
       
       Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.
       
       
       Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake
       
       But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.
       
       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       The elimination of world #1 FURIA and the underperformance of star rookie molodoy have triggered a sharp devaluation of FURIA assets, while NAVI’s upset victory has created a high-momentum "bull run" for their stickers, specifically for breakout rookie makazze. Risk is currently **High** due to extreme volatility and the collapse of the tournament's favorite-led price brackets, leaving the market in a speculative state ahead of the NAVI vs. FaZe semi-final. My recommendation is to **Buy** NAVI and makazze stickers to capitalize on the "Copenhagen underdog" narrative, while **Selling** FURIA positions immediately to avoid further losses following their premature exit.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With only a minor 3.20% dip, it is advisable to hold for a potential recovery rather than cutting losses, as taking profit is not currently an option.

       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.
       
       The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright
       
       
       
       
       
       Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.
       
       This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.
       
       If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

       The elimination of world #1 FURIA and the underperformance of star rookie molodoy have triggered a sharp devaluation of FURIA assets, while NAVI’s upset victory has created a high-momentum "bull run" for their stickers, specifically for breakout rookie makazze. Risk is currently **High** due to extreme volatility and the collapse of the tournament's favorite-led price brackets, leaving the market in a speculative state ahead of the NAVI vs. FaZe semi-final. My recommendation is to **Buy** NAVI and makazze stickers to capitalize on the "Copenhagen underdog" narrative, while **Selling** FURIA positions immediately to avoid further losses following their premature exit.

       NAVI rally after Inferno fumble to eliminate FURIA from Budapest in instant classic
       NER0cs
       13-12-2025 06:35
       Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.
       
       
       FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.
       
       It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.
       
       Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.
       
       
       Clip: FalleN punishes Natus Vincere's mistake in last-second 1v3 retake
       
       But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.
       
       As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.
       
       It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.
       
       
       Clip: iM comes one bullet away from a brilliant 1v5 clutch on Inferno
       
       On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.
       
       But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.
       
       And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.
       
       After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.
       
       molodoy's luck runs dry
       
       For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.
       
       And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.
       
       In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.
       
       On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.

Snax returns to GamerLegion
Sumljiv
13-12-2025 19:34
The Pole is back for a second stint in the organization.


GamerLegion have announced the return of Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski, with the Polish IGL set to take the place of the recently benched Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson.

The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves.

ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2.

At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL.

The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.

GamerLegion are currently:

Denmark Sebastian "⁠Tauson⁠" Tauson Lindelof
Czech Republic Oldřich "⁠PR⁠" Nový
Sweden Fredrik "⁠REZ⁠" Sterner
Poland Milan "⁠hypex⁠" Polowiec
Poland Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski

France Jeremy "⁠Kursy⁠" Gast (benched)
Sweden Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson (benched)
United Kingdom Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye (inactive)

The Serbian rifler was the longest-serving member of the active lineup.


Nemanja "⁠nexa⁠" Isaković has entered free agency after he and BC.Game "mutually agreed" to not extend his contract upon its expiry.

The 28-year-old joined the team in February to reunite with his former BLEED teammates, but several roster changes over the year soon left him as the sole remaining piece of that lineup.

The organization then made the shock signing of Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in July, although rumors point towards his contract expiring at the end of the year. The Ukrainian superstar was later reunited with former Natus Vincere teammate Denis "⁠electroNic⁠" Sharipov, but the team struggled to make a dent in the back half of the year with early exits at Red Bull GIBAWAY JOURNEY, XZONE Masters, and in several online competitions.

nexa averaged a 1.04 rating over 209 maps in his BC.Game stint as in-game leader, and heads into the off-season as a free agent.

BC.Game now have:

North Macedonia Aleksandar "⁠CacaNito⁠" Kjulukoski
Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev
Estonia Andreas "⁠aNdu⁠" Maasing
Russia Denis "⁠electroNic⁠" Sharipov

       The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves.

       ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
       This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2.
       
       At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL.
       
       The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.

       The market is currently reacting to speculative "legacy" narratives surrounding Snax’s return to GamerLegion and high volatility linked to s1mple’s looming contract expiration at BC.Game. Risk is **High** due to the declining competitive rankings of these organizations, which threatens the long-term price stability of their respective sticker assets. **HOLD** Snax-related items to capitalize on immediate "return" hype, but **SELL** into the volatility of BC.Game-adjacent assets before year-end contract expirations trigger a potential liquidity exit.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       With only a 3.20% loss, it is better to hold for a potential rebound rather than cutting losses on a minor market fluctuation.

Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
Nohte
15-12-2025 05:27
The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.


Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.

It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.

That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.


Clip: Vitality lift the trophy

To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.

"The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.

"I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."

ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.


Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long

Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.


"I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."

FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.

Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.

Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.

Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.

That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.


Clip: flameZ quad and 1v2 clutch kicks off Dust2

A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.

mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.

A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.

Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.

FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.

It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.


It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.

"One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.

"I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest

Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.


Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.

The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.

It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).

When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.

ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.

After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).

Most MVPs in a calendar year:
France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)

Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)

Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)

Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)

France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)

Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6

The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.

Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.

Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.

Most MVPs at Majors:
France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3

Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2

Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2

With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.

That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

>>> [STEP 2] FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
16:13:05 | INFO     | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16:13:05 | INFO     | 1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Nohte
       15-12-2025 05:27
       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.
       
       
       Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long
       
       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.
       
       
       Clip: flameZ quad and 1v2 clutch kicks off Dust2
       
       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.
       
       
       Clip: 2015 apEX styles on FaZe on B
       
       Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.
       
       It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.
       
       
       It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.
       
       "One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.
       
       "I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

       ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest
       NER0cs
       15-12-2025 06:27
       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.
       
       ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.
       
       After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).
       
       Most MVPs in a calendar year:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)
       
       Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6
       
       The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.
       
       Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.
       
       Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.
       
       Most MVPs at Majors:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3
       
       Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2
       
       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.
       
       ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.
       
       After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).
       
       Most MVPs in a calendar year:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)
       
       Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6
       
       The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.
       
       Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.
       
       Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.
       
       Most MVPs at Majors:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3
       
       Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2
       
       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
       2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
       3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, you should consider cutting your loss if you expect the downward trend to continue, as taking profit is not an option at this price.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest

       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.
       
       
       Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long
       
       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.
       
       
       Clip: flameZ quad and 1v2 clutch kicks off Dust2
       
       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.
       
       
       Clip: 2015 apEX styles on FaZe on B
       
       Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.
       
       It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.
       
       
       It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.
       
       "One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.
       
       "I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest

       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.
       
       
       Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long
       
       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.
       
       
       Clip: flameZ quad and 1v2 clutch kicks off Dust2
       
       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.
       
       
       Clip: 2015 apEX styles on FaZe on B
       
       Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.
       
       It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.
       
       
       It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.
       
       "One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.
       
       "I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

       ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest
       NER0cs
       15-12-2025 06:27
       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.
       
       ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.
       
       After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).
       
       Most MVPs in a calendar year:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)
       
       Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6
       
       The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.
       
       Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.
       
       Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.
       
       Most MVPs at Majors:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3
       
       Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2
       
       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
       2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
       3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is not an option, and a minor 2.70% decline typically suggests holding unless your original investment thesis has fundamentally changed or a specific stop-loss has been triggered.

       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.

       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.

That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.

       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.

       Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.
       
       It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.
       
       
       It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.
       
       "One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.
       
       "I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

       ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest
       NER0cs
       15-12-2025 06:27
       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.
       
       ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.
       
       After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).
       
       Most MVPs in a calendar year:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)
       
       Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6
       
       The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.
       
       Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.
       
       Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.
       
       Most MVPs at Majors:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3
       
       Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2
       
       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
       2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
       3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as a 2.65% decrease represents minor market volatility for a high-tier player item.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Nohte
       15-12-2025 05:27
       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.
       
       
       Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long
       
       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.

       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.

A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.

       ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest
       NER0cs
       15-12-2025 06:27
       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.
       
       ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.
       
       After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).
       
       Most MVPs in a calendar year:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)
       
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)
       
       Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6
       
       The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.
       
       Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.
       
       Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.
       
       Most MVPs at Majors:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3
       
       Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2
       
       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
       2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
       3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Given the 13.31% decline, it is advisable to cut your losses now to prevent further capital erosion.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Nohte
       15-12-2025 05:27
       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.
       
       
       Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long
       
       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.
       
       
       Clip: flameZ quad and 1v2 clutch kicks off Dust2
       
       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.
       
       
       Clip: 2015 apEX styles on FaZe on B
       
       Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.
       
       It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.
       
       
       It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.
       
       "One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.
       
       "I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

       ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest
       NER0cs
       15-12-2025 06:27
       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.

       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

       Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.
       
       
       Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.
       
       The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.
       
       It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).
       
       When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

       Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.
       
       ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.
       
       After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
       2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
       3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold, as a 0.25% gain is negligible and selling now would likely result in a net loss after transaction fees.

       Vitality beat FaZe 3-1 to become back-to-back Major champions in Budapest
       Nohte
       15-12-2025 05:27
       The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.
       
       
       Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

       flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
       FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.
       
       It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.
       
       That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.
       
       
       Clip: Vitality lift the trophy
       
       To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.
       
       "The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.
       
       "I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."
       
       ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.
       
       
       Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long
       
       Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.
       
       
       "I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."
       
       FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.
       
       Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.
       
       That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.
       
       
       Clip: flameZ quad and 1v2 clutch kicks off Dust2
       
       A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.
       
       mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.
       
       A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.
       
       
       Clip: 2015 apEX styles on FaZe on B
       
       Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.
       
       FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
       FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.
       
       It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.
       
       
       It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.
       
       "One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.
       
       "I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.

       Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.
       
       Most MVPs at Majors:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3
       
       Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2
       
       Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2
       
       With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.
       
       That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       1. The market risk is currently high due to "winner’s peak" pricing and the extreme speculative premium attached to Vitality assets following their historic back-to-back Major titles.
       2. Recommendation: **Sell** Vitality and ZywOo signature stickers to capitalize on the record-breaking 8-MVP hype, while **Holding** FaZe and jcobbb stickers as they are currently undervalued following the grand final loss.
       3. Financial data suggests that while ZywOo’s "GOAT" status provides long-term value, the immediate post-Major period typically triggers a significant price correction as hype buyers exit and supply remains high.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a loss, there is no profit to take, and a 3.8% decline is generally minor enough to warrant holding rather than cutting losses.

M80 part ways with HexT
Nohte
16-12-2025 02:43
The Canadian rifler is out of the team after six months.


M80 have announced the departure of Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma from their lineup following the expiry of his contract.

The 24-year-old rifler joined the organization in July to replace Ethan "⁠reck⁠" Serrano and averaged a 1.16 rating over 122 maps, most notably placing 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals and exiting Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1.

The team also won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 23 and a handful of online events in North America, and finished as runners-up at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

The change comes as a surprise on the heels of those results, with HexT admitting he was caught off-guard by the move.

"Safe to say I was a little surprised when I was told I wouldn’t be rejoining them for next season, but nonetheless I loved playing with the guys and they were some of my most favourite teammates to play with," HexT said in a post on X. "I’m now a free agent."

Following the change, M80 have:

United States Michael "⁠Swisher⁠" Schmid
Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich
Germany Elias "⁠s1n⁠" Stein
United States Mason "⁠Lake⁠" Sanderson

United Kingdom Rory "⁠dephh⁠" Jackson (coach)

The rifler will take HexT's place on the active roster.


M80 are set to unveil the signing of Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, sources familiar with the situation tell HLTV and Dust2.us.

The 21-year-old rifler would fill the gap left vacant by Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma after the organization announced it had not re-signed him after his contract expired, a move the Canadian rifler said left him "a little surprised."

M80 part ways with HexT
JBa has been on the sidelines since Wildcard transfer-listed and benched the entirety of its roster in November following a tumultuous 2025 and several dramatic lineup changes.

He was a part of the organization for two years, during which he averaged a 1.13 rating and attended his first two Majors in Shanghai and Austin. He joined Wildcard as a prospect under the tutelage of Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, and his impending addition to M80 would mark his second stint in a professional organization.

M80 ended 2025 with a run to Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they were eliminated with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1. The roster also attended a handful of international LANs over the year, including the BLAST.tv Austin Major, and notably won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta, placed 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals, and finished second at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

They were ranked 25th on the VRS in the December ranking update, enough to guarantee an invite to BLAST Bounty Season 3, and are currently ranked 22nd — enough to sit inside the preliminary invite range for IEM Kraków, which will use the January 5th ranking.

The team is also signed up to compete at Fragadelphia Miami, set to run from January 2-4, and fl0m Mythical LAN, scheduled for January 9-11.

With JBa, M80 would be:

The EVPs and All-Stars of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025
NER0cs & Striker
16-12-2025 19:18
Team efforts from the semi-finalists mean plenty of players did enough for EVP nods at the last event of the year.


StarLadder Budapest Major was an emphatic reminder of what should be on the tips of all our lips when we talk about 2025 years down the line.

Vitality's record-breaking year included nine trophies plus 15 consecutive semi-finals, and plenty of that was down to star man Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut.

ZywOo: "When Vitality are playing like this, no one can challenge us"
Having just kept hold of the MVP ahead of Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool thanks to his superior round win figures, ZywOo earned an eighth MVP of 2025 and became the first player since Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David to win two Major MVPs in the same calendar year.

At the start of the year, ZywOo was still behind Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in MVP count. But just twelve months later, the 25-year-old Frenchman has left his old nemesis seven medals behind.

Instead his focus will be on a new rival, 18-year-old Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets, ahead of a hotly anticipated HLTV Awards showdown in January.

Round Swing: the win probability sum of a player's actions


ropz was even closer to the MVP in Budapest than at any previous attempt at ZywOo's crown, after breaking his single map rating record against FaZe and a fantastic 1.40 playoff rating overall.

He had a big peak in every playoff series, including 31 frags in a crucial Mirage against Spirit in semis.

While ropz lost the MVP tiebreaker to ZywOo, a showing this strong at an event this prestigous will have as much impact as most MVPs on Top 20 discussions.


donk's Herculean effort to drag Spirit through the Major was not wasted, taking his yearly rating to 1.42 at notable events and 1.54 at the two Valve-sponsored events of 2025.

Seven of donk's nine maps ended above a 1.40 rating, with two above 2.00 and he has event stats of a 1.57 rating, 1.36 kills per round win, and +4.57% Swing.

His visible frustration after Mirage against Vitality followed him into a poor Dust2 as Spirit exited the Major, but donk's individual effort beforehand saw him reach a level very few players have ever been capable of.


William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman's quietly assured 2025 ends with his biggest peak yet, with key performances in the semi and grand final to push Vitality towards the trophy.

The British player, as Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire is so fond of calling him, posted his best ever Big Event rating on Inferno (2.00) in the grand final as he spearheaded Vitality's B-focused gameplan. In addition, he won eight clutches at the event, five of them in the grand final, and managed to have 76.9% of his opening deaths traded on T side (34.2% of all T deaths) at the same time in a masterclass of supportive rifling.

For a good chunk of Mirage against Spirit in semis, too, mezii was the only Vitality player fragging. He ended on 32 frags, but it was the first 15 or so, when ZywOo and ropz weren't at the races, that kept the team in a map that ended up being crucial for the series.


FaZe's miraculous run to the final was a team effort, but David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský was their most reliable piece after being the only player above 1.00 in the final and boasting a 1.36 rating in map wins and 1.01 KPRW at the event.

His 1.94-rated dismantling of eventual champions Vitality in round one of Swiss set the tone for a FaZe Clan that matured as they passed through the Major's many stages.

He was also solid in the arena, with 1.07 KPRW in playoffs and notable peaks against MOUZ and Natus Vincere, enough for a fourth EVP of 2025.


Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov's performance was rightly one of the big storylines from the Major, earning him praise from Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy and now his first EVP nod of the year.

He finished 11 of his 13 maps above a 1.00+ rating, in proof of a high floor, and also contributed with peaks in Natus Vincere's key series win over world number one FURIA in quarters. He was rated at 1.88 at half-time on Mirage, when NAVI led 8-4 on T side, and 1.92 on Train, when the scoreline was even more dominant 10-2, making w0nderful their most important player for the two map wins.

His raw statistics also make for impressive reading, with a 1.40 rating in map wins, 1.20 vs top 10, and 1.00 KPRW for a well-rounded, slam dunk, EVP case.


Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken could afford to coast slightly in groups as FaZe's map control pack surprisingly led the way, but he had the highest peaks of anyone on the team in playoffs to earn himself an EVP.

He had four strong playoff maps, with a 1.93 vs MOUZ, 1.87 vs Natus Vincere, and a 1.50 to open the final on Nuke vs Vitality. The fourth is the 13-11 Nuke win over NAVI, where Twistzz's 1.92-rated T side kept FaZe in the game long enough for his teammates to help make the eventual comeback.


Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants just loves Major finals. He's made it to the top two in four of his seven Major appearances, and despite a poor year individually, he returned to his form of old at a perfect time for FaZe Clan.

After a strong 1.19-rated group stage, the Latvian made the MOUZ quarter-final in his image, causing Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg to dub it "broky Friday" on the desk.

That moniker was earned, with a 40-frag showing enough to hand MOUZ one of their worst placings of 2025, and he added to the fun with another 20 frags on the decider against Natus Vincere to confirm an EVP.


Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan helped Natus Vincere's run to semis with a 1.26 rating in groups and 1.36 in their map wins, doing just enough in three strong playoff maps to confirm his EVP.

The Romanian has had to deal with a role shift and a decline in his team's fortunes, but ends the year with a 1.16 rating at super-elite events, 1.14 at Majors, and a pair of solid EVPs at Pro League 22 and now Budapest.


Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri ran more hot and cold than his two teammates above him on this list, but he ended up as Natus Vincere's best player in map wins (1.46 rating) after two astronomical playoff peaks.

A 2.23 vs FURIA on Train was a good start, even if lots of his impact came in the second half when Natus Vincere were 10-2 up already, but his true piece de resistance was a T side solo carry on Ancient against FaZe in semis (16-4 K-D, 143.2 ADR, 3.09 rating).

With two more maps above a 1.70 rating in groups, makazze's peaks were therefore strong enough that he was forgiven for some bad maps along the way, such was his importance to pushing Natus Vincere forward.


The final award goes to Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov, who makes it into the list after a great group stage (1.29 rating) and decent quarter-final (34-20 K-D, 1.23 rating) put him at a 1.27 rating and 0.81 KPR before the semi-final.

That was enough to confirm the EVP, with decent peaks against MOUZ and Liquid in groups adding to a case mainly built on consistency before that semi-final.

Given EVPs are often about how far you push your team forward, we cannot punish him too much for the quiet semi-final, given his hard work beforehand as donk's right-hand man.

The best players of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, in order:
France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut

Estonia Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool

Russia Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets

United Kingdom William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman

Slovakia David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský

Ukraine Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov

Canada Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken

Latvia Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants

Romania Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan

Kosovo Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri

Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov

Honorable mentions
Despite the long EVP list, no players from the quarter-finals made it into the list after fairly one-sided matches prevented them from confirming their EVPs.

Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's 1.54-rated group stage put him right on the edge, but a 1.03 rating (with a negative K-D and Swing) quarter-final was not enough to finalize his EVP. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko had the same situation but worse, having a 1.41 in groups but bottom fragging against Natus Vincere.

Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski's pistol rounds and decent groups were great for FaZe but the rookie did struggle in playoffs, preventing an EVP.


FURIA's star duo missed out on EVPs after quiet quarter-finals
Ayush "⁠mzinho⁠" Batbold 's floor was fantastic in Budapest, but his Ancient against G2 in groups was his only true peak and he needed slightly more for an EVP.

Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin led Falcons in groups but also fell short of confirmation in the arena with a 1.04-rated quarter-final.

Finally, Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol deserves a mention for his 1.21-rated group stage effort, as do Alexandre "⁠bodyy⁠" Pianaro (1.25) and Santino "⁠try⁠" Rigal (1.18).

All-Stars

Our now familiar limit of three players per team comes into effect for the All-Stars, as apEX misses out despite a 62.2% T side win-rate.

That decision was made because of a lack of anchors with anywhere near the level mezii showed in Budapest, who has this slot alongside his high EVP.

Top performers ZywOo, ropz, and donk then form a terrifying (and balanced) star trio, with an average event rating of 1.44 between them.

With no room for a fourth Vitality player in apEX then, we have space to accommodate Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen as IGL to represent FaZe's fantastic run to the Major final from 11th in the world ranking.

The team has made its third change of the off-season.


BC.Game have announced the benching of Aleksandar "⁠CacaNito⁠" Kjulukoski, leaving the organization with just three players on the active roster following the departures of Nemanja "⁠nexa⁠" Isaković and Luka "⁠emi⁠" Vuković.

It is the second time the Macedonian rifler has been moved to the team's reserves after he was benched alongside Jonas "⁠Lekr0⁠" Olofsson in February to make way for Cai "⁠CYPHER⁠" Watson and nexa.

He returned to the roster in May ahead of IEM Dallas to replace Joakim "⁠jkaem⁠" Myrbostad after the Norwegian was embroiled in several scandals and accused of owing over $300,000 in gambling debt.

CacaNito first joined BC.Game in June 2024 and was the longest-serving member of the roster despite his time on the bench.

He averaged a 1.00 rating over 228 maps, during which the team competed almost exclusively in online competitions and made just two LAN appearances on HLTV at IEM Dallas and Red Bull GIBAWAY JOURNEY, and notably won ESL Challenge League Season 50 Europe Cup 2 shortly after Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's surprise addition.

His benching leaves the team with the following lineup:

Estonia Andreas "⁠aNdu⁠" Maasing
Russia Denis "⁠electroNic⁠" Sharipov

Norway Joakim "⁠jkaem⁠" Myrbostad (benched)

       The team also won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 23 and a handful of online events in North America, and finished as runners-up at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.
       
       The change comes as a surprise on the heels of those results, with HexT admitting he was caught off-guard by the move.
       
       "Safe to say I was a little surprised when I was told I wouldn’t be rejoining them for next season, but nonetheless I loved playing with the guys and they were some of my most favourite teammates to play with," HexT said in a post on X. "I’m now a free agent."
       
       Following the change, M80 have:
       
       United States Michael "⁠Swisher⁠" Schmid
       Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich
       Germany Elias "⁠s1n⁠" Stein

       M80 are set to unveil the signing of Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, sources familiar with the situation tell HLTV and Dust2.us.
       
       The 21-year-old rifler would fill the gap left vacant by Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma after the organization announced it had not re-signed him after his contract expired, a move the Canadian rifler said left him "a little surprised."

       M80 part ways with HexT
       JBa has been on the sidelines since Wildcard transfer-listed and benched the entirety of its roster in November following a tumultuous 2025 and several dramatic lineup changes.
       
       He was a part of the organization for two years, during which he averaged a 1.13 rating and attended his first two Majors in Shanghai and Austin. He joined Wildcard as a prospect under the tutelage of Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, and his impending addition to M80 would mark his second stint in a professional organization.
       
       M80 ended 2025 with a run to Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they were eliminated with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1. The roster also attended a handful of international LANs over the year, including the BLAST.tv Austin Major, and notably won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta, placed 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals, and finished second at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

       The EVPs and All-Stars of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025
       NER0cs & Striker
       16-12-2025 19:18
       Team efforts from the semi-finalists mean plenty of players did enough for EVP nods at the last event of the year.
       
       
       StarLadder Budapest Major was an emphatic reminder of what should be on the tips of all our lips when we talk about 2025 years down the line.
       
       Vitality's record-breaking year included nine trophies plus 15 consecutive semi-finals, and plenty of that was down to star man Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut.

       ZywOo: "When Vitality are playing like this, no one can challenge us"
       Having just kept hold of the MVP ahead of Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool thanks to his superior round win figures, ZywOo earned an eighth MVP of 2025 and became the first player since Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David to win two Major MVPs in the same calendar year.
       
       At the start of the year, ZywOo was still behind Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in MVP count. But just twelve months later, the 25-year-old Frenchman has left his old nemesis seven medals behind.
       
       Instead his focus will be on a new rival, 18-year-old Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets, ahead of a hotly anticipated HLTV Awards showdown in January.

       ropz was even closer to the MVP in Budapest than at any previous attempt at ZywOo's crown, after breaking his single map rating record against FaZe and a fantastic 1.40 playoff rating overall.
       
       He had a big peak in every playoff series, including 31 frags in a crucial Mirage against Spirit in semis.
       
       While ropz lost the MVP tiebreaker to ZywOo, a showing this strong at an event this prestigous will have as much impact as most MVPs on Top 20 discussions.
       
       
       donk's Herculean effort to drag Spirit through the Major was not wasted, taking his yearly rating to 1.42 at notable events and 1.54 at the two Valve-sponsored events of 2025.
       
       Seven of donk's nine maps ended above a 1.40 rating, with two above 2.00 and he has event stats of a 1.57 rating, 1.36 kills per round win, and +4.57% Swing.
       
       His visible frustration after Mirage against Vitality followed him into a poor Dust2 as Spirit exited the Major, but donk's individual effort beforehand saw him reach a level very few players have ever been capable of.
       
       
       William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman's quietly assured 2025 ends with his biggest peak yet, with key performances in the semi and grand final to push Vitality towards the trophy.
       
       The British player, as Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire is so fond of calling him, posted his best ever Big Event rating on Inferno (2.00) in the grand final as he spearheaded Vitality's B-focused gameplan. In addition, he won eight clutches at the event, five of them in the grand final, and managed to have 76.9% of his opening deaths traded on T side (34.2% of all T deaths) at the same time in a masterclass of supportive rifling.
       
       For a good chunk of Mirage against Spirit in semis, too, mezii was the only Vitality player fragging. He ended on 32 frags, but it was the first 15 or so, when ZywOo and ropz weren't at the races, that kept the team in a map that ended up being crucial for the series.
       
       
       FaZe's miraculous run to the final was a team effort, but David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský was their most reliable piece after being the only player above 1.00 in the final and boasting a 1.36 rating in map wins and 1.01 KPRW at the event.
       
       His 1.94-rated dismantling of eventual champions Vitality in round one of Swiss set the tone for a FaZe Clan that matured as they passed through the Major's many stages.
       
       He was also solid in the arena, with 1.07 KPRW in playoffs and notable peaks against MOUZ and Natus Vincere, enough for a fourth EVP of 2025.
       
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov's performance was rightly one of the big storylines from the Major, earning him praise from Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy and now his first EVP nod of the year.
       
       He finished 11 of his 13 maps above a 1.00+ rating, in proof of a high floor, and also contributed with peaks in Natus Vincere's key series win over world number one FURIA in quarters. He was rated at 1.88 at half-time on Mirage, when NAVI led 8-4 on T side, and 1.92 on Train, when the scoreline was even more dominant 10-2, making w0nderful their most important player for the two map wins.
       
       His raw statistics also make for impressive reading, with a 1.40 rating in map wins, 1.20 vs top 10, and 1.00 KPRW for a well-rounded, slam dunk, EVP case.
       
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken could afford to coast slightly in groups as FaZe's map control pack surprisingly led the way, but he had the highest peaks of anyone on the team in playoffs to earn himself an EVP.
       
       He had four strong playoff maps, with a 1.93 vs MOUZ, 1.87 vs Natus Vincere, and a 1.50 to open the final on Nuke vs Vitality. The fourth is the 13-11 Nuke win over NAVI, where Twistzz's 1.92-rated T side kept FaZe in the game long enough for his teammates to help make the eventual comeback.
       
       
       Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants just loves Major finals. He's made it to the top two in four of his seven Major appearances, and despite a poor year individually, he returned to his form of old at a perfect time for FaZe Clan.
       
       After a strong 1.19-rated group stage, the Latvian made the MOUZ quarter-final in his image, causing Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg to dub it "broky Friday" on the desk.
       
       That moniker was earned, with a 40-frag showing enough to hand MOUZ one of their worst placings of 2025, and he added to the fun with another 20 frags on the decider against Natus Vincere to confirm an EVP.
       
       
       Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan helped Natus Vincere's run to semis with a 1.26 rating in groups and 1.36 in their map wins, doing just enough in three strong playoff maps to confirm his EVP.
       
       The Romanian has had to deal with a role shift and a decline in his team's fortunes, but ends the year with a 1.16 rating at super-elite events, 1.14 at Majors, and a pair of solid EVPs at Pro League 22 and now Budapest.
       
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri ran more hot and cold than his two teammates above him on this list, but he ended up as Natus Vincere's best player in map wins (1.46 rating) after two astronomical playoff peaks.
       
       A 2.23 vs FURIA on Train was a good start, even if lots of his impact came in the second half when Natus Vincere were 10-2 up already, but his true piece de resistance was a T side solo carry on Ancient against FaZe in semis (16-4 K-D, 143.2 ADR, 3.09 rating).
       
       With two more maps above a 1.70 rating in groups, makazze's peaks were therefore strong enough that he was forgiven for some bad maps along the way, such was his importance to pushing Natus Vincere forward.
       
       
       The final award goes to Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov, who makes it into the list after a great group stage (1.29 rating) and decent quarter-final (34-20 K-D, 1.23 rating) put him at a 1.27 rating and 0.81 KPR before the semi-final.
       
       That was enough to confirm the EVP, with decent peaks against MOUZ and Liquid in groups adding to a case mainly built on consistency before that semi-final.
       
       Given EVPs are often about how far you push your team forward, we cannot punish him too much for the quiet semi-final, given his hard work beforehand as donk's right-hand man.
       
       The best players of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, in order:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut
       
       Estonia Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool
       
       Russia Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       
       United Kingdom William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman
       
       Slovakia David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský
       
       Ukraine Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov
       
       Canada Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken
       
       Latvia Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants
       
       Romania Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan
       
       Kosovo Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri
       
       Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov
       
       Honorable mentions
       Despite the long EVP list, no players from the quarter-finals made it into the list after fairly one-sided matches prevented them from confirming their EVPs.
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's 1.54-rated group stage put him right on the edge, but a 1.03 rating (with a negative K-D and Swing) quarter-final was not enough to finalize his EVP. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko had the same situation but worse, having a 1.41 in groups but bottom fragging against Natus Vincere.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski's pistol rounds and decent groups were great for FaZe but the rookie did struggle in playoffs, preventing an EVP.
       
       
       FURIA's star duo missed out on EVPs after quiet quarter-finals
       Ayush "⁠mzinho⁠" Batbold 's floor was fantastic in Budapest, but his Ancient against G2 in groups was his only true peak and he needed slightly more for an EVP.
       
       Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin led Falcons in groups but also fell short of confirmation in the arena with a 1.04-rated quarter-final.
       
       Finally, Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol deserves a mention for his 1.21-rated group stage effort, as do Alexandre "⁠bodyy⁠" Pianaro (1.25) and Santino "⁠try⁠" Rigal (1.18).
       
       All-Stars
       
       Our now familiar limit of three players per team comes into effect for the All-Stars, as apEX misses out despite a 62.2% T side win-rate.
       
       That decision was made because of a lack of anchors with anywhere near the level mezii showed in Budapest, who has this slot alongside his high EVP.
       
       Top performers ZywOo, ropz, and donk then form a terrifying (and balanced) star trio, with an average event rating of 1.44 between them.
       
       With no room for a fourth Vitality player in apEX then, we have space to accommodate Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen as IGL to represent FaZe's fantastic run to the Major final from 11th in the world ranking.

       The market faces moderate-to-high volatility as the post-StarLadder Budapest Major "winner's premium" for Vitality and FaZe assets peaks alongside a wave of end-of-season roster instability in teams like M80 and BC.Game. ZywOo’s record-breaking eighth MVP of 2025 and donk’s 1.54 Major rating solidify Vitality and Spirit as blue-chip holdings, while HexT’s unexpected departure from M80 signals a liquidity exit for his specific player autographs. **HOLD** top-tier Vitality and Spirit stickers to capitalize on historical dominance, but **SELL** FaZe and M80 positions now to realize gains before the anticipated January market correction.

       M80 part ways with HexT
       Nohte
       16-12-2025 02:43
       The Canadian rifler is out of the team after six months.
       
       
       M80 have announced the departure of Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma from their lineup following the expiry of his contract.
       
       The 24-year-old rifler joined the organization in July to replace Ethan "⁠reck⁠" Serrano and averaged a 1.16 rating over 122 maps, most notably placing 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals and exiting Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1.
       
       The team also won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 23 and a handful of online events in North America, and finished as runners-up at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.
       
       The change comes as a surprise on the heels of those results, with HexT admitting he was caught off-guard by the move.
       
       "Safe to say I was a little surprised when I was told I wouldn’t be rejoining them for next season, but nonetheless I loved playing with the guys and they were some of my most favourite teammates to play with," HexT said in a post on X. "I’m now a free agent."

       M80 are set to unveil the signing of Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, sources familiar with the situation tell HLTV and Dust2.us.
       
       The 21-year-old rifler would fill the gap left vacant by Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma after the organization announced it had not re-signed him after his contract expired, a move the Canadian rifler said left him "a little surprised."

       M80 part ways with HexT
       JBa has been on the sidelines since Wildcard transfer-listed and benched the entirety of its roster in November following a tumultuous 2025 and several dramatic lineup changes.
       
       He was a part of the organization for two years, during which he averaged a 1.13 rating and attended his first two Majors in Shanghai and Austin. He joined Wildcard as a prospect under the tutelage of Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, and his impending addition to M80 would mark his second stint in a professional organization.
       
       M80 ended 2025 with a run to Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they were eliminated with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1. The roster also attended a handful of international LANs over the year, including the BLAST.tv Austin Major, and notably won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta, placed 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals, and finished second at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

       The EVPs and All-Stars of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025

       Team efforts from the semi-finalists mean plenty of players did enough for EVP nods at the last event of the year.
       
       
       StarLadder Budapest Major was an emphatic reminder of what should be on the tips of all our lips when we talk about 2025 years down the line.
       
       Vitality's record-breaking year included nine trophies plus 15 consecutive semi-finals, and plenty of that was down to star man Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut.

       ZywOo: "When Vitality are playing like this, no one can challenge us"
       Having just kept hold of the MVP ahead of Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool thanks to his superior round win figures, ZywOo earned an eighth MVP of 2025 and became the first player since Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David to win two Major MVPs in the same calendar year.
       
       At the start of the year, ZywOo was still behind Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in MVP count. But just twelve months later, the 25-year-old Frenchman has left his old nemesis seven medals behind.
       
       Instead his focus will be on a new rival, 18-year-old Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets, ahead of a hotly anticipated HLTV Awards showdown in January.

       ropz was even closer to the MVP in Budapest than at any previous attempt at ZywOo's crown, after breaking his single map rating record against FaZe and a fantastic 1.40 playoff rating overall.
       
       He had a big peak in every playoff series, including 31 frags in a crucial Mirage against Spirit in semis.
       
       While ropz lost the MVP tiebreaker to ZywOo, a showing this strong at an event this prestigous will have as much impact as most MVPs on Top 20 discussions.
       
       
       donk's Herculean effort to drag Spirit through the Major was not wasted, taking his yearly rating to 1.42 at notable events and 1.54 at the two Valve-sponsored events of 2025.
       
       Seven of donk's nine maps ended above a 1.40 rating, with two above 2.00 and he has event stats of a 1.57 rating, 1.36 kills per round win, and +4.57% Swing.
       
       His visible frustration after Mirage against Vitality followed him into a poor Dust2 as Spirit exited the Major, but donk's individual effort beforehand saw him reach a level very few players have ever been capable of.
       
       
       William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman's quietly assured 2025 ends with his biggest peak yet, with key performances in the semi and grand final to push Vitality towards the trophy.
       
       The British player, as Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire is so fond of calling him, posted his best ever Big Event rating on Inferno (2.00) in the grand final as he spearheaded Vitality's B-focused gameplan. In addition, he won eight clutches at the event, five of them in the grand final, and managed to have 76.9% of his opening deaths traded on T side (34.2% of all T deaths) at the same time in a masterclass of supportive rifling.
       
       For a good chunk of Mirage against Spirit in semis, too, mezii was the only Vitality player fragging. He ended on 32 frags, but it was the first 15 or so, when ZywOo and ropz weren't at the races, that kept the team in a map that ended up being crucial for the series.
       
       
       FaZe's miraculous run to the final was a team effort, but David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský was their most reliable piece after being the only player above 1.00 in the final and boasting a 1.36 rating in map wins and 1.01 KPRW at the event.
       
       His 1.94-rated dismantling of eventual champions Vitality in round one of Swiss set the tone for a FaZe Clan that matured as they passed through the Major's many stages.
       
       He was also solid in the arena, with 1.07 KPRW in playoffs and notable peaks against MOUZ and Natus Vincere, enough for a fourth EVP of 2025.
       
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov's performance was rightly one of the big storylines from the Major, earning him praise from Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy and now his first EVP nod of the year.
       
       He finished 11 of his 13 maps above a 1.00+ rating, in proof of a high floor, and also contributed with peaks in Natus Vincere's key series win over world number one FURIA in quarters. He was rated at 1.88 at half-time on Mirage, when NAVI led 8-4 on T side, and 1.92 on Train, when the scoreline was even more dominant 10-2, making w0nderful their most important player for the two map wins.
       
       His raw statistics also make for impressive reading, with a 1.40 rating in map wins, 1.20 vs top 10, and 1.00 KPRW for a well-rounded, slam dunk, EVP case.
       
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken could afford to coast slightly in groups as FaZe's map control pack surprisingly led the way, but he had the highest peaks of anyone on the team in playoffs to earn himself an EVP.
       
       He had four strong playoff maps, with a 1.93 vs MOUZ, 1.87 vs Natus Vincere, and a 1.50 to open the final on Nuke vs Vitality. The fourth is the 13-11 Nuke win over NAVI, where Twistzz's 1.92-rated T side kept FaZe in the game long enough for his teammates to help make the eventual comeback.
       
       
       Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants just loves Major finals. He's made it to the top two in four of his seven Major appearances, and despite a poor year individually, he returned to his form of old at a perfect time for FaZe Clan.
       
       After a strong 1.19-rated group stage, the Latvian made the MOUZ quarter-final in his image, causing Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg to dub it "broky Friday" on the desk.
       
       That moniker was earned, with a 40-frag showing enough to hand MOUZ one of their worst placings of 2025, and he added to the fun with another 20 frags on the decider against Natus Vincere to confirm an EVP.
       
       
       Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan helped Natus Vincere's run to semis with a 1.26 rating in groups and 1.36 in their map wins, doing just enough in three strong playoff maps to confirm his EVP.
       
       The Romanian has had to deal with a role shift and a decline in his team's fortunes, but ends the year with a 1.16 rating at super-elite events, 1.14 at Majors, and a pair of solid EVPs at Pro League 22 and now Budapest.
       
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri ran more hot and cold than his two teammates above him on this list, but he ended up as Natus Vincere's best player in map wins (1.46 rating) after two astronomical playoff peaks.
       
       A 2.23 vs FURIA on Train was a good start, even if lots of his impact came in the second half when Natus Vincere were 10-2 up already, but his true piece de resistance was a T side solo carry on Ancient against FaZe in semis (16-4 K-D, 143.2 ADR, 3.09 rating).
       
       With two more maps above a 1.70 rating in groups, makazze's peaks were therefore strong enough that he was forgiven for some bad maps along the way, such was his importance to pushing Natus Vincere forward.
       
       
       The final award goes to Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov, who makes it into the list after a great group stage (1.29 rating) and decent quarter-final (34-20 K-D, 1.23 rating) put him at a 1.27 rating and 0.81 KPR before the semi-final.
       
       That was enough to confirm the EVP, with decent peaks against MOUZ and Liquid in groups adding to a case mainly built on consistency before that semi-final.
       
       Given EVPs are often about how far you push your team forward, we cannot punish him too much for the quiet semi-final, given his hard work beforehand as donk's right-hand man.
       
       The best players of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, in order:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut
       
       Estonia Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool
       
       Russia Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       
       United Kingdom William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman
       
       Slovakia David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský
       
       Ukraine Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov
       
       Canada Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken
       
       Latvia Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants
       
       Romania Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan
       
       Kosovo Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri
       
       Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov
       
       Honorable mentions
       Despite the long EVP list, no players from the quarter-finals made it into the list after fairly one-sided matches prevented them from confirming their EVPs.
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's 1.54-rated group stage put him right on the edge, but a 1.03 rating (with a negative K-D and Swing) quarter-final was not enough to finalize his EVP. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko had the same situation but worse, having a 1.41 in groups but bottom fragging against Natus Vincere.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski's pistol rounds and decent groups were great for FaZe but the rookie did struggle in playoffs, preventing an EVP.
       
       
       FURIA's star duo missed out on EVPs after quiet quarter-finals
       Ayush "⁠mzinho⁠" Batbold 's floor was fantastic in Budapest, but his Ancient against G2 in groups was his only true peak and he needed slightly more for an EVP.
       
       Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin led Falcons in groups but also fell short of confirmation in the arena with a 1.04-rated quarter-final.
       
       Finally, Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol deserves a mention for his 1.21-rated group stage effort, as do Alexandre "⁠bodyy⁠" Pianaro (1.25) and Santino "⁠try⁠" Rigal (1.18).
       
       All-Stars
       
       Our now familiar limit of three players per team comes into effect for the All-Stars, as apEX misses out despite a 62.2% T side win-rate.
       
       That decision was made because of a lack of anchors with anywhere near the level mezii showed in Budapest, who has this slot alongside his high EVP.
       
       Top performers ZywOo, ropz, and donk then form a terrifying (and balanced) star trio, with an average event rating of 1.44 between them.
       
       With no room for a fourth Vitality player in apEX then, we have space to accommodate Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen as IGL to represent FaZe's fantastic run to the Major final from 11th in the world ranking.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market faces moderate-to-high volatility as the post-StarLadder Budapest Major "winner's premium" for Vitality and FaZe assets peaks alongside a wave of end-of-season roster instability in teams like M80 and BC.Game. ZywOo’s record-breaking eighth MVP of 2025 and donk’s 1.54 Major rating solidify Vitality and Spirit as blue-chip holdings, while HexT’s unexpected departure from M80 signals a liquidity exit for his specific player autographs. **HOLD** top-tier Vitality and Spirit stickers to capitalize on historical dominance, but **SELL** FaZe and M80 positions now to realize gains before the anticipated January market correction.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the price remains unchanged at your entry point, there is currently no profit to realize or loss to mitigate, making it a neutral hold.
16:16:13 | INFO     |     -> Decision for rain: HOLD, Reason: 虽然目前持仓处于 -13.34% 的亏损状态，且金融分析报告建议卖出 FaZe 仓位以应对 1 月份可能的市场回调，但从技术面和心理预期来看，rain 这种级别的老将资产在 Major 结束后通常会进入一段稳定的价值区间。今日 75/100 的情绪评分显示市场对 FaZe 决赛表现的余温尚存。考虑到交易平台高额的手续费，此时卖出将面临巨大的实质性亏损。鉴于 FaZe 依然是顶级强队且选手个人基本面稳固，建议继续持有，等待明年 1 月 HLTV Top 20 颁奖礼或新赛季开赛前后的市场情绪回升再寻找更好的离场时机。

       M80 part ways with HexT
       Nohte
       16-12-2025 02:43
       The Canadian rifler is out of the team after six months.
       
       
       M80 have announced the departure of Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma from their lineup following the expiry of his contract.
       
       The 24-year-old rifler joined the organization in July to replace Ethan "⁠reck⁠" Serrano and averaged a 1.16 rating over 122 maps, most notably placing 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals and exiting Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1.
       
       The team also won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 23 and a handful of online events in North America, and finished as runners-up at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.
       
       The change comes as a surprise on the heels of those results, with HexT admitting he was caught off-guard by the move.
       
       "Safe to say I was a little surprised when I was told I wouldn’t be rejoining them for next season, but nonetheless I loved playing with the guys and they were some of my most favourite teammates to play with," HexT said in a post on X. "I’m now a free agent."
       
       Following the change, M80 have:
       
       United States Michael "⁠Swisher⁠" Schmid
       Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich
       Germany Elias "⁠s1n⁠" Stein

       16-12-2025 05:57
       The rifler will take HexT's place on the active roster.
       
       
       M80 are set to unveil the signing of Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, sources familiar with the situation tell HLTV and Dust2.us.
       
       The 21-year-old rifler would fill the gap left vacant by Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma after the organization announced it had not re-signed him after his contract expired, a move the Canadian rifler said left him "a little surprised."

       M80 part ways with HexT
       JBa has been on the sidelines since Wildcard transfer-listed and benched the entirety of its roster in November following a tumultuous 2025 and several dramatic lineup changes.
       
       He was a part of the organization for two years, during which he averaged a 1.13 rating and attended his first two Majors in Shanghai and Austin. He joined Wildcard as a prospect under the tutelage of Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, and his impending addition to M80 would mark his second stint in a professional organization.
       
       M80 ended 2025 with a run to Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they were eliminated with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1. The roster also attended a handful of international LANs over the year, including the BLAST.tv Austin Major, and notably won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta, placed 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals, and finished second at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

       The team is also signed up to compete at Fragadelphia Miami, set to run from January 2-4, and fl0m Mythical LAN, scheduled for January 9-11.

       Team efforts from the semi-finalists mean plenty of players did enough for EVP nods at the last event of the year.
       
       
       StarLadder Budapest Major was an emphatic reminder of what should be on the tips of all our lips when we talk about 2025 years down the line.
       
       Vitality's record-breaking year included nine trophies plus 15 consecutive semi-finals, and plenty of that was down to star man Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut.

       ZywOo: "When Vitality are playing like this, no one can challenge us"
       Having just kept hold of the MVP ahead of Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool thanks to his superior round win figures, ZywOo earned an eighth MVP of 2025 and became the first player since Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David to win two Major MVPs in the same calendar year.
       
       At the start of the year, ZywOo was still behind Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in MVP count. But just twelve months later, the 25-year-old Frenchman has left his old nemesis seven medals behind.
       
       Instead his focus will be on a new rival, 18-year-old Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets, ahead of a hotly anticipated HLTV Awards showdown in January.

       ropz was even closer to the MVP in Budapest than at any previous attempt at ZywOo's crown, after breaking his single map rating record against FaZe and a fantastic 1.40 playoff rating overall.
       
       He had a big peak in every playoff series, including 31 frags in a crucial Mirage against Spirit in semis.
       
       While ropz lost the MVP tiebreaker to ZywOo, a showing this strong at an event this prestigous will have as much impact as most MVPs on Top 20 discussions.
       
       
       donk's Herculean effort to drag Spirit through the Major was not wasted, taking his yearly rating to 1.42 at notable events and 1.54 at the two Valve-sponsored events of 2025.
       
       Seven of donk's nine maps ended above a 1.40 rating, with two above 2.00 and he has event stats of a 1.57 rating, 1.36 kills per round win, and +4.57% Swing.
       
       His visible frustration after Mirage against Vitality followed him into a poor Dust2 as Spirit exited the Major, but donk's individual effort beforehand saw him reach a level very few players have ever been capable of.
       
       
       William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman's quietly assured 2025 ends with his biggest peak yet, with key performances in the semi and grand final to push Vitality towards the trophy.
       
       The British player, as Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire is so fond of calling him, posted his best ever Big Event rating on Inferno (2.00) in the grand final as he spearheaded Vitality's B-focused gameplan. In addition, he won eight clutches at the event, five of them in the grand final, and managed to have 76.9% of his opening deaths traded on T side (34.2% of all T deaths) at the same time in a masterclass of supportive rifling.
       
       For a good chunk of Mirage against Spirit in semis, too, mezii was the only Vitality player fragging. He ended on 32 frags, but it was the first 15 or so, when ZywOo and ropz weren't at the races, that kept the team in a map that ended up being crucial for the series.
       
       
       FaZe's miraculous run to the final was a team effort, but David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský was their most reliable piece after being the only player above 1.00 in the final and boasting a 1.36 rating in map wins and 1.01 KPRW at the event.
       
       His 1.94-rated dismantling of eventual champions Vitality in round one of Swiss set the tone for a FaZe Clan that matured as they passed through the Major's many stages.
       
       He was also solid in the arena, with 1.07 KPRW in playoffs and notable peaks against MOUZ and Natus Vincere, enough for a fourth EVP of 2025.
       
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov's performance was rightly one of the big storylines from the Major, earning him praise from Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy and now his first EVP nod of the year.
       
       He finished 11 of his 13 maps above a 1.00+ rating, in proof of a high floor, and also contributed with peaks in Natus Vincere's key series win over world number one FURIA in quarters. He was rated at 1.88 at half-time on Mirage, when NAVI led 8-4 on T side, and 1.92 on Train, when the scoreline was even more dominant 10-2, making w0nderful their most important player for the two map wins.
       
       His raw statistics also make for impressive reading, with a 1.40 rating in map wins, 1.20 vs top 10, and 1.00 KPRW for a well-rounded, slam dunk, EVP case.
       
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken could afford to coast slightly in groups as FaZe's map control pack surprisingly led the way, but he had the highest peaks of anyone on the team in playoffs to earn himself an EVP.
       
       He had four strong playoff maps, with a 1.93 vs MOUZ, 1.87 vs Natus Vincere, and a 1.50 to open the final on Nuke vs Vitality. The fourth is the 13-11 Nuke win over NAVI, where Twistzz's 1.92-rated T side kept FaZe in the game long enough for his teammates to help make the eventual comeback.
       
       
       Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants just loves Major finals. He's made it to the top two in four of his seven Major appearances, and despite a poor year individually, he returned to his form of old at a perfect time for FaZe Clan.
       
       After a strong 1.19-rated group stage, the Latvian made the MOUZ quarter-final in his image, causing Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg to dub it "broky Friday" on the desk.
       
       That moniker was earned, with a 40-frag showing enough to hand MOUZ one of their worst placings of 2025, and he added to the fun with another 20 frags on the decider against Natus Vincere to confirm an EVP.
       
       
       Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan helped Natus Vincere's run to semis with a 1.26 rating in groups and 1.36 in their map wins, doing just enough in three strong playoff maps to confirm his EVP.
       
       The Romanian has had to deal with a role shift and a decline in his team's fortunes, but ends the year with a 1.16 rating at super-elite events, 1.14 at Majors, and a pair of solid EVPs at Pro League 22 and now Budapest.
       
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri ran more hot and cold than his two teammates above him on this list, but he ended up as Natus Vincere's best player in map wins (1.46 rating) after two astronomical playoff peaks.
       
       A 2.23 vs FURIA on Train was a good start, even if lots of his impact came in the second half when Natus Vincere were 10-2 up already, but his true piece de resistance was a T side solo carry on Ancient against FaZe in semis (16-4 K-D, 143.2 ADR, 3.09 rating).
       
       With two more maps above a 1.70 rating in groups, makazze's peaks were therefore strong enough that he was forgiven for some bad maps along the way, such was his importance to pushing Natus Vincere forward.
       
       
       The final award goes to Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov, who makes it into the list after a great group stage (1.29 rating) and decent quarter-final (34-20 K-D, 1.23 rating) put him at a 1.27 rating and 0.81 KPR before the semi-final.
       
       That was enough to confirm the EVP, with decent peaks against MOUZ and Liquid in groups adding to a case mainly built on consistency before that semi-final.
       
       Given EVPs are often about how far you push your team forward, we cannot punish him too much for the quiet semi-final, given his hard work beforehand as donk's right-hand man.
       
       The best players of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, in order:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut
       
       Estonia Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool
       
       Russia Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       
       United Kingdom William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman
       
       Slovakia David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský
       
       Ukraine Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov
       
       Canada Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken
       
       Latvia Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants
       
       Romania Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan
       
       Kosovo Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri
       
       Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov
       
       Honorable mentions
       Despite the long EVP list, no players from the quarter-finals made it into the list after fairly one-sided matches prevented them from confirming their EVPs.
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's 1.54-rated group stage put him right on the edge, but a 1.03 rating (with a negative K-D and Swing) quarter-final was not enough to finalize his EVP. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko had the same situation but worse, having a 1.41 in groups but bottom fragging against Natus Vincere.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski's pistol rounds and decent groups were great for FaZe but the rookie did struggle in playoffs, preventing an EVP.
       
       
       FURIA's star duo missed out on EVPs after quiet quarter-finals
       Ayush "⁠mzinho⁠" Batbold 's floor was fantastic in Budapest, but his Ancient against G2 in groups was his only true peak and he needed slightly more for an EVP.
       
       Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin led Falcons in groups but also fell short of confirmation in the arena with a 1.04-rated quarter-final.
       
       Finally, Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol deserves a mention for his 1.21-rated group stage effort, as do Alexandre "⁠bodyy⁠" Pianaro (1.25) and Santino "⁠try⁠" Rigal (1.18).
       
       All-Stars
       
       Our now familiar limit of three players per team comes into effect for the All-Stars, as apEX misses out despite a 62.2% T side win-rate.
       
       That decision was made because of a lack of anchors with anywhere near the level mezii showed in Budapest, who has this slot alongside his high EVP.
       
       Top performers ZywOo, ropz, and donk then form a terrifying (and balanced) star trio, with an average event rating of 1.44 between them.
       
       With no room for a fourth Vitality player in apEX then, we have space to accommodate Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen as IGL to represent FaZe's fantastic run to the Major final from 11th in the world ranking.

       The market faces moderate-to-high volatility as the post-StarLadder Budapest Major "winner's premium" for Vitality and FaZe assets peaks alongside a wave of end-of-season roster instability in teams like M80 and BC.Game.

       M80 part ways with HexT
       Nohte
       16-12-2025 02:43
       The Canadian rifler is out of the team after six months.
       
       
       M80 have announced the departure of Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma from their lineup following the expiry of his contract.
       
       The 24-year-old rifler joined the organization in July to replace Ethan "⁠reck⁠" Serrano and averaged a 1.16 rating over 122 maps, most notably placing 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals and exiting Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1.
       
       The team also won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 23 and a handful of online events in North America, and finished as runners-up at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.
       
       The change comes as a surprise on the heels of those results, with HexT admitting he was caught off-guard by the move.
       
       "Safe to say I was a little surprised when I was told I wouldn’t be rejoining them for next season, but nonetheless I loved playing with the guys and they were some of my most favourite teammates to play with," HexT said in a post on X. "I’m now a free agent."
       
       Following the change, M80 have:
       
       United States Michael "⁠Swisher⁠" Schmid
       Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich
       Germany Elias "⁠s1n⁠" Stein

       16-12-2025 05:57
       The rifler will take HexT's place on the active roster.
       
       
       M80 are set to unveil the signing of Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, sources familiar with the situation tell HLTV and Dust2.us.
       
       The 21-year-old rifler would fill the gap left vacant by Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma after the organization announced it had not re-signed him after his contract expired, a move the Canadian rifler said left him "a little surprised."

       M80 part ways with HexT
       JBa has been on the sidelines since Wildcard transfer-listed and benched the entirety of its roster in November following a tumultuous 2025 and several dramatic lineup changes.
       
       He was a part of the organization for two years, during which he averaged a 1.13 rating and attended his first two Majors in Shanghai and Austin. He joined Wildcard as a prospect under the tutelage of Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, and his impending addition to M80 would mark his second stint in a professional organization.
       
       M80 ended 2025 with a run to Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they were eliminated with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1. The roster also attended a handful of international LANs over the year, including the BLAST.tv Austin Major, and notably won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta, placed 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals, and finished second at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

       They were ranked 25th on the VRS in the December ranking update, enough to guarantee an invite to BLAST Bounty Season 3, and are currently ranked 22nd — enough to sit inside the preliminary invite range for IEM Kraków, which will use the January 5th ranking.
       
       The team is also signed up to compete at Fragadelphia Miami, set to run from January 2-4, and fl0m Mythical LAN, scheduled for January 9-11.
       
       With JBa, M80 would be:

       Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich

       The EVPs and All-Stars of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025

       16-12-2025 19:18
       Team efforts from the semi-finalists mean plenty of players did enough for EVP nods at the last event of the year.
       
       
       StarLadder Budapest Major was an emphatic reminder of what should be on the tips of all our lips when we talk about 2025 years down the line.
       
       Vitality's record-breaking year included nine trophies plus 15 consecutive semi-finals, and plenty of that was down to star man Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut.

       ZywOo: "When Vitality are playing like this, no one can challenge us"
       Having just kept hold of the MVP ahead of Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool thanks to his superior round win figures, ZywOo earned an eighth MVP of 2025 and became the first player since Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David to win two Major MVPs in the same calendar year.
       
       At the start of the year, ZywOo was still behind Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in MVP count. But just twelve months later, the 25-year-old Frenchman has left his old nemesis seven medals behind.
       
       Instead his focus will be on a new rival, 18-year-old Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets, ahead of a hotly anticipated HLTV Awards showdown in January.

       ropz was even closer to the MVP in Budapest than at any previous attempt at ZywOo's crown, after breaking his single map rating record against FaZe and a fantastic 1.40 playoff rating overall.
       
       He had a big peak in every playoff series, including 31 frags in a crucial Mirage against Spirit in semis.
       
       While ropz lost the MVP tiebreaker to ZywOo, a showing this strong at an event this prestigous will have as much impact as most MVPs on Top 20 discussions.
       
       
       donk's Herculean effort to drag Spirit through the Major was not wasted, taking his yearly rating to 1.42 at notable events and 1.54 at the two Valve-sponsored events of 2025.
       
       Seven of donk's nine maps ended above a 1.40 rating, with two above 2.00 and he has event stats of a 1.57 rating, 1.36 kills per round win, and +4.57% Swing.
       
       His visible frustration after Mirage against Vitality followed him into a poor Dust2 as Spirit exited the Major, but donk's individual effort beforehand saw him reach a level very few players have ever been capable of.
       
       
       William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman's quietly assured 2025 ends with his biggest peak yet, with key performances in the semi and grand final to push Vitality towards the trophy.
       
       The British player, as Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire is so fond of calling him, posted his best ever Big Event rating on Inferno (2.00) in the grand final as he spearheaded Vitality's B-focused gameplan. In addition, he won eight clutches at the event, five of them in the grand final, and managed to have 76.9% of his opening deaths traded on T side (34.2% of all T deaths) at the same time in a masterclass of supportive rifling.
       
       For a good chunk of Mirage against Spirit in semis, too, mezii was the only Vitality player fragging. He ended on 32 frags, but it was the first 15 or so, when ZywOo and ropz weren't at the races, that kept the team in a map that ended up being crucial for the series.
       
       
       FaZe's miraculous run to the final was a team effort, but David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský was their most reliable piece after being the only player above 1.00 in the final and boasting a 1.36 rating in map wins and 1.01 KPRW at the event.
       
       His 1.94-rated dismantling of eventual champions Vitality in round one of Swiss set the tone for a FaZe Clan that matured as they passed through the Major's many stages.
       
       He was also solid in the arena, with 1.07 KPRW in playoffs and notable peaks against MOUZ and Natus Vincere, enough for a fourth EVP of 2025.
       
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov's performance was rightly one of the big storylines from the Major, earning him praise from Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy and now his first EVP nod of the year.
       
       He finished 11 of his 13 maps above a 1.00+ rating, in proof of a high floor, and also contributed with peaks in Natus Vincere's key series win over world number one FURIA in quarters. He was rated at 1.88 at half-time on Mirage, when NAVI led 8-4 on T side, and 1.92 on Train, when the scoreline was even more dominant 10-2, making w0nderful their most important player for the two map wins.
       
       His raw statistics also make for impressive reading, with a 1.40 rating in map wins, 1.20 vs top 10, and 1.00 KPRW for a well-rounded, slam dunk, EVP case.
       
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken could afford to coast slightly in groups as FaZe's map control pack surprisingly led the way, but he had the highest peaks of anyone on the team in playoffs to earn himself an EVP.
       
       He had four strong playoff maps, with a 1.93 vs MOUZ, 1.87 vs Natus Vincere, and a 1.50 to open the final on Nuke vs Vitality. The fourth is the 13-11 Nuke win over NAVI, where Twistzz's 1.92-rated T side kept FaZe in the game long enough for his teammates to help make the eventual comeback.
       
       
       Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants just loves Major finals. He's made it to the top two in four of his seven Major appearances, and despite a poor year individually, he returned to his form of old at a perfect time for FaZe Clan.
       
       After a strong 1.19-rated group stage, the Latvian made the MOUZ quarter-final in his image, causing Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg to dub it "broky Friday" on the desk.
       
       That moniker was earned, with a 40-frag showing enough to hand MOUZ one of their worst placings of 2025, and he added to the fun with another 20 frags on the decider against Natus Vincere to confirm an EVP.
       
       
       Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan helped Natus Vincere's run to semis with a 1.26 rating in groups and 1.36 in their map wins, doing just enough in three strong playoff maps to confirm his EVP.
       
       The Romanian has had to deal with a role shift and a decline in his team's fortunes, but ends the year with a 1.16 rating at super-elite events, 1.14 at Majors, and a pair of solid EVPs at Pro League 22 and now Budapest.
       
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri ran more hot and cold than his two teammates above him on this list, but he ended up as Natus Vincere's best player in map wins (1.46 rating) after two astronomical playoff peaks.
       
       A 2.23 vs FURIA on Train was a good start, even if lots of his impact came in the second half when Natus Vincere were 10-2 up already, but his true piece de resistance was a T side solo carry on Ancient against FaZe in semis (16-4 K-D, 143.2 ADR, 3.09 rating).
       
       With two more maps above a 1.70 rating in groups, makazze's peaks were therefore strong enough that he was forgiven for some bad maps along the way, such was his importance to pushing Natus Vincere forward.
       
       
       The final award goes to Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov, who makes it into the list after a great group stage (1.29 rating) and decent quarter-final (34-20 K-D, 1.23 rating) put him at a 1.27 rating and 0.81 KPR before the semi-final.
       
       That was enough to confirm the EVP, with decent peaks against MOUZ and Liquid in groups adding to a case mainly built on consistency before that semi-final.
       
       Given EVPs are often about how far you push your team forward, we cannot punish him too much for the quiet semi-final, given his hard work beforehand as donk's right-hand man.

       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut

       Ukraine Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov

       Kosovo Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri
       
       Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov
       
       Honorable mentions
       Despite the long EVP list, no players from the quarter-finals made it into the list after fairly one-sided matches prevented them from confirming their EVPs.
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's 1.54-rated group stage put him right on the edge, but a 1.03 rating (with a negative K-D and Swing) quarter-final was not enough to finalize his EVP. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko had the same situation but worse, having a 1.41 in groups but bottom fragging against Natus Vincere.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski's pistol rounds and decent groups were great for FaZe but the rookie did struggle in playoffs, preventing an EVP.
       
       
       FURIA's star duo missed out on EVPs after quiet quarter-finals
       Ayush "⁠mzinho⁠" Batbold 's floor was fantastic in Budapest, but his Ancient against G2 in groups was his only true peak and he needed slightly more for an EVP.
       
       Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin led Falcons in groups but also fell short of confirmation in the arena with a 1.04-rated quarter-final.
       
       Finally, Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol deserves a mention for his 1.21-rated group stage effort, as do Alexandre "⁠bodyy⁠" Pianaro (1.25) and Santino "⁠try⁠" Rigal (1.18).
       
       All-Stars
       
       Our now familiar limit of three players per team comes into effect for the All-Stars, as apEX misses out despite a 62.2% T side win-rate.
       
       That decision was made because of a lack of anchors with anywhere near the level mezii showed in Budapest, who has this slot alongside his high EVP.
       
       Top performers ZywOo, ropz, and donk then form a terrifying (and balanced) star trio, with an average event rating of 1.44 between them.
       
       With no room for a fourth Vitality player in apEX then, we have space to accommodate Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen as IGL to represent FaZe's fantastic run to the Major final from 11th in the world ranking.

       He averaged a 1.00 rating over 228 maps, during which the team competed almost exclusively in online competitions and made just two LAN appearances on HLTV at IEM Dallas and Red Bull GIBAWAY JOURNEY, and notably won ESL Challenge League Season 50 Europe Cup 2 shortly after Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's surprise addition.

       The market faces moderate-to-high volatility as the post-StarLadder Budapest Major "winner's premium" for Vitality and FaZe assets peaks alongside a wave of end-of-season roster instability in teams like M80 and BC.Game. ZywOo’s record-breaking eighth MVP of 2025 and donk’s 1.54 Major rating solidify Vitality and Spirit as blue-chip holdings, while HexT’s unexpected departure from M80 signals a liquidity exit for his specific player autographs. **HOLD** top-tier Vitality and Spirit stickers to capitalize on historical dominance, but **SELL** FaZe and M80 positions now to realize gains before the anticipated January market correction.

       M80 part ways with HexT
       Nohte
       16-12-2025 02:43
       The Canadian rifler is out of the team after six months.
       
       
       M80 have announced the departure of Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma from their lineup following the expiry of his contract.
       
       The 24-year-old rifler joined the organization in July to replace Ethan "⁠reck⁠" Serrano and averaged a 1.16 rating over 122 maps, most notably placing 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals and exiting Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1.
       
       The team also won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 23 and a handful of online events in North America, and finished as runners-up at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.
       
       The change comes as a surprise on the heels of those results, with HexT admitting he was caught off-guard by the move.
       
       "Safe to say I was a little surprised when I was told I wouldn’t be rejoining them for next season, but nonetheless I loved playing with the guys and they were some of my most favourite teammates to play with," HexT said in a post on X. "I’m now a free agent."
       
       Following the change, M80 have:
       
       United States Michael "⁠Swisher⁠" Schmid
       Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich
       Germany Elias "⁠s1n⁠" Stein
       United States Mason "⁠Lake⁠" Sanderson
       
       United Kingdom Rory "⁠dephh⁠" Jackson (coach)
       
       
       Sources: M80 set to sign JBa
       Nohte & MIRAA
       16-12-2025 05:57
       The rifler will take HexT's place on the active roster.
       
       
       M80 are set to unveil the signing of Josh "⁠JBa⁠" Barutt, sources familiar with the situation tell HLTV and Dust2.us.
       
       The 21-year-old rifler would fill the gap left vacant by Jadan "⁠HexT⁠" Postma after the organization announced it had not re-signed him after his contract expired, a move the Canadian rifler said left him "a little surprised."

       M80 part ways with HexT
       JBa has been on the sidelines since Wildcard transfer-listed and benched the entirety of its roster in November following a tumultuous 2025 and several dramatic lineup changes.
       
       He was a part of the organization for two years, during which he averaged a 1.13 rating and attended his first two Majors in Shanghai and Austin. He joined Wildcard as a prospect under the tutelage of Peter "⁠stanislaw⁠" Jarguz, and his impending addition to M80 would mark his second stint in a professional organization.
       
       M80 ended 2025 with a run to Stage 2 of the StarLadder Budapest Major, where they were eliminated with a 2-3 record after going 3-0 through Stage 1. The roster also attended a handful of international LANs over the year, including the BLAST.tv Austin Major, and notably won DreamHack Knockout Atlanta, placed 5-6th at BLAST Open London Finals, and finished second at Fragadelphia 19 and Fragadelphia Ultra Mega Jersey.

       They were ranked 25th on the VRS in the December ranking update, enough to guarantee an invite to BLAST Bounty Season 3, and are currently ranked 22nd — enough to sit inside the preliminary invite range for IEM Kraków, which will use the January 5th ranking.
       
       The team is also signed up to compete at Fragadelphia Miami, set to run from January 2-4, and fl0m Mythical LAN, scheduled for January 9-11.
       
       With JBa, M80 would be:
       
       United States Michael "⁠Swisher⁠" Schmid
       Germany Fritz "⁠slaxz-⁠" Dietrich

       The EVPs and All-Stars of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025
       NER0cs & Striker
       16-12-2025 19:18
       Team efforts from the semi-finalists mean plenty of players did enough for EVP nods at the last event of the year.
       
       
       StarLadder Budapest Major was an emphatic reminder of what should be on the tips of all our lips when we talk about 2025 years down the line.
       
       Vitality's record-breaking year included nine trophies plus 15 consecutive semi-finals, and plenty of that was down to star man Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut.
       
       
       Read more
       ZywOo: "When Vitality are playing like this, no one can challenge us"
       Having just kept hold of the MVP ahead of Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool thanks to his superior round win figures, ZywOo earned an eighth MVP of 2025 and became the first player since Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David to win two Major MVPs in the same calendar year.
       
       At the start of the year, ZywOo was still behind Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev in MVP count. But just twelve months later, the 25-year-old Frenchman has left his old nemesis seven medals behind.
       
       Instead his focus will be on a new rival, 18-year-old Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets, ahead of a hotly anticipated HLTV Awards showdown in January.

       ropz was even closer to the MVP in Budapest than at any previous attempt at ZywOo's crown, after breaking his single map rating record against FaZe and a fantastic 1.40 playoff rating overall.
       
       He had a big peak in every playoff series, including 31 frags in a crucial Mirage against Spirit in semis.
       
       While ropz lost the MVP tiebreaker to ZywOo, a showing this strong at an event this prestigous will have as much impact as most MVPs on Top 20 discussions.
       
       
       donk's Herculean effort to drag Spirit through the Major was not wasted, taking his yearly rating to 1.42 at notable events and 1.54 at the two Valve-sponsored events of 2025.
       
       Seven of donk's nine maps ended above a 1.40 rating, with two above 2.00 and he has event stats of a 1.57 rating, 1.36 kills per round win, and +4.57% Swing.
       
       His visible frustration after Mirage against Vitality followed him into a poor Dust2 as Spirit exited the Major, but donk's individual effort beforehand saw him reach a level very few players have ever been capable of.
       
       
       William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman's quietly assured 2025 ends with his biggest peak yet, with key performances in the semi and grand final to push Vitality towards the trophy.
       
       The British player, as Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire is so fond of calling him, posted his best ever Big Event rating on Inferno (2.00) in the grand final as he spearheaded Vitality's B-focused gameplan. In addition, he won eight clutches at the event, five of them in the grand final, and managed to have 76.9% of his opening deaths traded on T side (34.2% of all T deaths) at the same time in a masterclass of supportive rifling.
       
       For a good chunk of Mirage against Spirit in semis, too, mezii was the only Vitality player fragging. He ended on 32 frags, but it was the first 15 or so, when ZywOo and ropz weren't at the races, that kept the team in a map that ended up being crucial for the series.
       
       
       FaZe's miraculous run to the final was a team effort, but David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský was their most reliable piece after being the only player above 1.00 in the final and boasting a 1.36 rating in map wins and 1.01 KPRW at the event.
       
       His 1.94-rated dismantling of eventual champions Vitality in round one of Swiss set the tone for a FaZe Clan that matured as they passed through the Major's many stages.
       
       He was also solid in the arena, with 1.07 KPRW in playoffs and notable peaks against MOUZ and Natus Vincere, enough for a fourth EVP of 2025.
       
       
       Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov's performance was rightly one of the big storylines from the Major, earning him praise from Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy and now his first EVP nod of the year.
       
       He finished 11 of his 13 maps above a 1.00+ rating, in proof of a high floor, and also contributed with peaks in Natus Vincere's key series win over world number one FURIA in quarters. He was rated at 1.88 at half-time on Mirage, when NAVI led 8-4 on T side, and 1.92 on Train, when the scoreline was even more dominant 10-2, making w0nderful their most important player for the two map wins.
       
       His raw statistics also make for impressive reading, with a 1.40 rating in map wins, 1.20 vs top 10, and 1.00 KPRW for a well-rounded, slam dunk, EVP case.
       
       
       Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken could afford to coast slightly in groups as FaZe's map control pack surprisingly led the way, but he had the highest peaks of anyone on the team in playoffs to earn himself an EVP.
       
       He had four strong playoff maps, with a 1.93 vs MOUZ, 1.87 vs Natus Vincere, and a 1.50 to open the final on Nuke vs Vitality. The fourth is the 13-11 Nuke win over NAVI, where Twistzz's 1.92-rated T side kept FaZe in the game long enough for his teammates to help make the eventual comeback.
       
       
       Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants just loves Major finals. He's made it to the top two in four of his seven Major appearances, and despite a poor year individually, he returned to his form of old at a perfect time for FaZe Clan.
       
       After a strong 1.19-rated group stage, the Latvian made the MOUZ quarter-final in his image, causing Alex "⁠Mauisnake⁠" Ellenberg to dub it "broky Friday" on the desk.
       
       That moniker was earned, with a 40-frag showing enough to hand MOUZ one of their worst placings of 2025, and he added to the fun with another 20 frags on the decider against Natus Vincere to confirm an EVP.
       
       
       Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan helped Natus Vincere's run to semis with a 1.26 rating in groups and 1.36 in their map wins, doing just enough in three strong playoff maps to confirm his EVP.
       
       The Romanian has had to deal with a role shift and a decline in his team's fortunes, but ends the year with a 1.16 rating at super-elite events, 1.14 at Majors, and a pair of solid EVPs at Pro League 22 and now Budapest.
       
       
       Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri ran more hot and cold than his two teammates above him on this list, but he ended up as Natus Vincere's best player in map wins (1.46 rating) after two astronomical playoff peaks.
       
       A 2.23 vs FURIA on Train was a good start, even if lots of his impact came in the second half when Natus Vincere were 10-2 up already, but his true piece de resistance was a T side solo carry on Ancient against FaZe in semis (16-4 K-D, 143.2 ADR, 3.09 rating).
       
       With two more maps above a 1.70 rating in groups, makazze's peaks were therefore strong enough that he was forgiven for some bad maps along the way, such was his importance to pushing Natus Vincere forward.
       
       
       The final award goes to Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov, who makes it into the list after a great group stage (1.29 rating) and decent quarter-final (34-20 K-D, 1.23 rating) put him at a 1.27 rating and 0.81 KPR before the semi-final.
       
       That was enough to confirm the EVP, with decent peaks against MOUZ and Liquid in groups adding to a case mainly built on consistency before that semi-final.
       
       Given EVPs are often about how far you push your team forward, we cannot punish him too much for the quiet semi-final, given his hard work beforehand as donk's right-hand man.
       
       The best players of StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, in order:
       France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut
       
       Estonia Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool
       
       Russia Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
       
       United Kingdom William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman
       
       Slovakia David "⁠frozen⁠" Čerňanský
       
       Ukraine Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov
       
       Canada Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken
       
       Latvia Helvijs "⁠broky⁠" Saukants
       
       Romania Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan
       
       Kosovo Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri
       
       Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov
       
       Honorable mentions
       Despite the long EVP list, no players from the quarter-finals made it into the list after fairly one-sided matches prevented them from confirming their EVPs.
       
       Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's 1.54-rated group stage put him right on the edge, but a 1.03 rating (with a negative K-D and Swing) quarter-final was not enough to finalize his EVP. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko had the same situation but worse, having a 1.41 in groups but bottom fragging against Natus Vincere.
       
       Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski's pistol rounds and decent groups were great for FaZe but the rookie did struggle in playoffs, preventing an EVP.
       
       
       FURIA's star duo missed out on EVPs after quiet quarter-finals
       Ayush "⁠mzinho⁠" Batbold 's floor was fantastic in Budapest, but his Ancient against G2 in groups was his only true peak and he needed slightly more for an EVP.
       
       Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin led Falcons in groups but also fell short of confirmation in the arena with a 1.04-rated quarter-final.
       
       Finally, Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol deserves a mention for his 1.21-rated group stage effort, as do Alexandre "⁠bodyy⁠" Pianaro (1.25) and Santino "⁠try⁠" Rigal (1.18).
       
       All-Stars
       
       Our now familiar limit of three players per team comes into effect for the All-Stars, as apEX misses out despite a 62.2% T side win-rate.
       
       That decision was made because of a lack of anchors with anywhere near the level mezii showed in Budapest, who has this slot alongside his high EVP.
       
       Top performers ZywOo, ropz, and donk then form a terrifying (and balanced) star trio, with an average event rating of 1.44 between them.
       
       With no room for a fourth Vitality player in apEX then, we have space to accommodate Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen as IGL to represent FaZe's fantastic run to the Major final from 11th in the world ranking.

       The team has made its third change of the off-season.
       
       
       BC.Game have announced the benching of Aleksandar "⁠CacaNito⁠" Kjulukoski, leaving the organization with just three players on the active roster following the departures of Nemanja "⁠nexa⁠" Isaković and Luka "⁠emi⁠" Vuković.

       BC.Game part ways with nexa
       It is the second time the Macedonian rifler has been moved to the team's reserves after he was benched alongside Jonas "⁠Lekr0⁠" Olofsson in February to make way for Cai "⁠CYPHER⁠" Watson and nexa.
       
       He returned to the roster in May ahead of IEM Dallas to replace Joakim "⁠jkaem⁠" Myrbostad after the Norwegian was embroiled in several scandals and accused of owing over $300,000 in gambling debt.

       BC.Game bench jkaem following accusations of him owing $300,000 in gambling debt
       CacaNito first joined BC.Game in June 2024 and was the longest-serving member of the roster despite his time on the bench.
       
       He averaged a 1.00 rating over 228 maps, during which the team competed almost exclusively in online competitions and made just two LAN appearances on HLTV at IEM Dallas and Red Bull GIBAWAY JOURNEY, and notably won ESL Challenge League Season 50 Europe Cup 2 shortly after Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's surprise addition.
       
       His benching leaves the team with the following lineup:
       
       Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev
       Estonia Andreas "⁠aNdu⁠" Maasing
       Russia Denis "⁠electroNic⁠" Sharipov

       Germany Luca "⁠pr1metapz⁠" Voigt (benched)
       North Macedonia Aleksandar "⁠CacaNito⁠" Kjulukoski (benched)
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The market faces moderate-to-high volatility as the post-StarLadder Budapest Major "winner's premium" for Vitality and FaZe assets peaks alongside a wave of end-of-season roster instability in teams like M80 and BC.Game. ZywOo’s record-breaking eighth MVP of 2025 and donk’s 1.54 Major rating solidify Vitality and Spirit as blue-chip holdings, while HexT’s unexpected departure from M80 signals a liquidity exit for his specific player autographs. **HOLD** top-tier Vitality and Spirit stickers to capitalize on historical dominance, but **SELL** FaZe and M80 positions now to realize gains before the anticipated January market correction.

degster announces free agency

17-12-2025 22:13
The Russian sniper is on the market after eight months on Falcons' bench.


Abdul "⁠degster⁠" Gasanov has announced his free agency following the termination of his contract with Falcons, bringing to an end the AWPer's year-long stint with the Saudi organization.

"I can confidently say that I have a tireless desire to work to achieve success with a new team and organization," degster said in a statement on X.

degster initially signed for Falcons in January of this year alongside Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski and René "⁠TeSeS⁠" Madsen, joining as part of the former HEROIC core that would bring with them their VRS points.

Falcons bench degster ahead of m0NESY arrival
Falcons were set to bring Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov onboard in a blockbuster signing soon after said PGL Bucharest run, thus degster was relegated to the bench to make room for the incoming superstar.

Since his benching degster has a single HLTV-recorded official in the books, playing alongside Timur "⁠FL4MUS⁠" Marev and Andrey "⁠Jerry⁠" Mekhryakov in mix-team MAJOR WINNERS in July. They lost their only game in the ESL Pro League Season 22 open qualifier.

       degster announces free agency

       17-12-2025 22:13
       The Russian sniper is on the market after eight months on Falcons' bench.
       
       
       Abdul "⁠degster⁠" Gasanov has announced his free agency following the termination of his contract with Falcons, bringing to an end the AWPer's year-long stint with the Saudi organization.
       
       "I can confidently say that I have a tireless desire to work to achieve success with a new team and organization," degster said in a statement on X.
       
       degster initially signed for Falcons in January of this year alongside Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski and René "⁠TeSeS⁠" Madsen, joining as part of the former HEROIC core that would bring with them their VRS points.

       Falcons were set to bring Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov onboard in a blockbuster signing soon after said PGL Bucharest run, thus degster was relegated to the bench to make room for the incoming superstar.
       
       Since his benching degster has a single HLTV-recorded official in the books, playing alongside Timur "⁠FL4MUS⁠" Marev and Andrey "⁠Jerry⁠" Mekhryakov in mix-team MAJOR WINNERS in July. They lost their only game in the ESL Pro League Season 22 open qualifier.
       
       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       The transition of degster to free agency creates immediate speculative demand for his existing sticker supply, particularly his Falcons and OG iterations, as the market anticipates his signing to a new Tier-1 roster. Risk is currently **High** due to the eight-month inactivity period and the potential for a "buy the rumor, sell the news" correction once his next organization is officially announced. My recommendation is to **Hold** existing positions to capture the hype-driven price spike, while avoiding new entries until a definitive team destination provides a clearer long-term value floor.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold, as the 0.25% gain is negligible and selling now would likely result in a net loss after transaction fees.

After winning his fourth Major, apEX sets new targets
MIRAA
18-12-2025 21:30
Vitality's skipper said his team still needs to claim more silverware before it can be considered the greatest of all time.


It took Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire over three years to fulfill his dream of winning a Major as an in-game leader after Vitality offered him the role in January 2020. But in the two and a half years since the title run in Paris, he has added two more Major crowns to his résumé, having guided the team to victory in Austin and Budapest.

With Sunday's win against FaZe at the MVM Dome, apEX joins an exclusive club of players with at least four Major titles (he had won his first in 2015 in Cluj-Napoca while with Envy). Only five other players have achieved that feat, and they were all part of the record-breaking Astralis roster that defined an era. That's great company to have.

"When you win one, you want to be among the IGLs who have won two, and etcetera," apEX told HLTV after the final. "I'm so happy. I have a wonderful team. Wonderful teammates who help me on a daily basis to be the best captain that I can be.

"When I started as an IGL, I didn't expect that one day I'd have four Majors under my belt and three as an IGL. It's crazy."

Each of his three Major titles holds distinct significance. The Paris victory will always have a special place in his heart due to the event's location and the fact that "no one expected us [to win] in a way because we had won only one trophy before."


apEX won his first Major as an IGL in 2023 in Paris
Austin, he said, was the crowning moment of a near-perfect season. As for Budapest, he admitted it is slightly "less impactful" than the other two.

"We were not the favorites, but if people are smart enough, they know that, in the big tournament, the best team of the year can bounce back," he said. "That's what we did."

Vitality's Budapest run caps an incredible year that saw them win nine titles (including the two Majors and IEM Katowice) in addition to a Grand Slam.

The conversation has shifted all of a sudden. It's no longer about whether we're in the Vitality era — that seems to be a given. It has now turned into a greatest-of-all-time debate.

As Vitality chase the Grand Slam, where is apEX in the pantheon of great IGLs?
On the morning of the final against FaZe, apEX found himself wondering how his team's year would stack up against Astralis' 2018 in case he lifted the trophy in Budapest. So he crunched the numbers.

"Astralis won ten out of 18 in one year, we did nine out of 16," he said. "It's a better percentage on our side. In 2018, they only won one Major. We won two.

"So basically, for the year, I think we are maybe a bit above, even though they added Magisk a bit later in the year and they started to win when they had him.

"But for the best team of all time, we need to wait. We have only had one successful year, a crazy successful year. But we are up there, maybe top two, top three. It depends on where people put fnatic and NIP. I think SK are a bit behind. They won Majors, but not as many trophies as we did this year.

"People will always argue about who is the best. They liked Astralis because there were no, like, big star players. gla1ve could frag more than me. It's always the same. I don't know who the best is. Anyway, what we did this year is crazy."


Following an exceptional 2025 season, Vitality now carry the burden of being the team to beat, with many rivals expected to make changes in the winter break to challenge their dominance.

But apEX seems unfazed by such potential distractions. His main focus is how he can add to his team's legacy — and his own — as they continue to rewrite the history books.

"The first goal of next year is the back-to-back Grand Slam," he said. "That would be nice. It starts in Krakow, so we already have a big thing for Krakow.

"And then, yeah, going back to the Major in Cologne and trying our best there. It's a good place to win. I've had decent results there every time. Hopefully, maybe a third Major in a row there. Let's see."

16:18:00 | INFO     | The risk level is currently moderate-to-high as the market enters a post-Major "cool-down" phase and the winter break, which typically triggers profit-taking and lower liquidity despite Vitality's historic dominance. 

**HOLD** your Vitality-specific positions (Paris 2023, Austin 2025, and Budapest 2025) to capitalize on their "GOAT" era brand equity, but **SELL** generic Budapest team stickers to lock in gains before the seasonal market correction. 

While Vitality’s pursuit of a back-to-back Grand Slam in Krakow sustains long-term demand for their items, the immediate saturation of nine trophies in one year suggests a temporary price ceiling for their newest tournament assets.

       As Vitality chase the Grand Slam, where is apEX in the pantheon of great IGLs?
       On the morning of the final against FaZe, apEX found himself wondering how his team's year would stack up against Astralis' 2018 in case he lifted the trophy in Budapest. So he crunched the numbers.
       
       "Astralis won ten out of 18 in one year, we did nine out of 16," he said. "It's a better percentage on our side. In 2018, they only won one Major. We won two.
       
       "So basically, for the year, I think we are maybe a bit above, even though they added Magisk a bit later in the year and they started to win when they had him.
       
       "But for the best team of all time, we need to wait. We have only had one successful year, a crazy successful year. But we are up there, maybe top two, top three. It depends on where people put fnatic and NIP. I think SK are a bit behind. They won Majors, but not as many trophies as we did this year.
       
       "People will always argue about who is the best. They liked Astralis because there were no, like, big star players. gla1ve could frag more than me. It's always the same. I don't know who the best is. Anyway, what we did this year is crazy."
       
       
       Following an exceptional 2025 season, Vitality now carry the burden of being the team to beat, with many rivals expected to make changes in the winter break to challenge their dominance.
       
       But apEX seems unfazed by such potential distractions. His main focus is how he can add to his team's legacy — and his own — as they continue to rewrite the history books.
       
       "The first goal of next year is the back-to-back Grand Slam," he said. "That would be nice. It starts in Krakow, so we already have a big thing for Krakow.
       
       "And then, yeah, going back to the Major in Cologne and trying our best there. It's a good place to win. I've had decent results there every time. Hopefully, maybe a third Major in a row there. Let's see."

       The risk level is currently moderate-to-high as the market enters a post-Major "cool-down" phase and the winter break, which typically triggers profit-taking and lower liquidity despite Vitality's historic dominance. 
       
       **HOLD** your Vitality-specific positions (Paris 2023, Austin 2025, and Budapest 2025) to capitalize on their "GOAT" era brand equity, but **SELL** generic Budapest team stickers to lock in gains before the seasonal market correction. 
       
       While Vitality’s pursuit of a back-to-back Grand Slam in Krakow sustains long-term demand for their items, the immediate saturation of nine trophies in one year suggests a temporary price ceiling for their newest tournament assets.

       With zero price movement and no profit to realize, it is best to hold the asset and wait for potential appreciation.

       After winning his fourth Major, apEX sets new targets
       MIRAA
       18-12-2025 21:30
       Vitality's skipper said his team still needs to claim more silverware before it can be considered the greatest of all time.
       
       
       It took Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire over three years to fulfill his dream of winning a Major as an in-game leader after Vitality offered him the role in January 2020. But in the two and a half years since the title run in Paris, he has added two more Major crowns to his résumé, having guided the team to victory in Austin and Budapest.
       
       With Sunday's win against FaZe at the MVM Dome, apEX joins an exclusive club of players with at least four Major titles (he had won his first in 2015 in Cluj-Napoca while with Envy). Only five other players have achieved that feat, and they were all part of the record-breaking Astralis roster that defined an era. That's great company to have.
       
       "When you win one, you want to be among the IGLs who have won two, and etcetera," apEX told HLTV after the final. "I'm so happy. I have a wonderful team. Wonderful teammates who help me on a daily basis to be the best captain that I can be.
       
       "When I started as an IGL, I didn't expect that one day I'd have four Majors under my belt and three as an IGL. It's crazy."
       
       Each of his three Major titles holds distinct significance. The Paris victory will always have a special place in his heart due to the event's location and the fact that "no one expected us [to win] in a way because we had won only one trophy before."

       "Astralis won ten out of 18 in one year, we did nine out of 16," he said. "It's a better percentage on our side. In 2018, they only won one Major. We won two.
       
       "So basically, for the year, I think we are maybe a bit above, even though they added Magisk a bit later in the year and they started to win when they had him.
       
       "But for the best team of all time, we need to wait. We have only had one successful year, a crazy successful year. But we are up there, maybe top two, top three. It depends on where people put fnatic and NIP. I think SK are a bit behind. They won Majors, but not as many trophies as we did this year.
       
       "People will always argue about who is the best. They liked Astralis because there were no, like, big star players. gla1ve could frag more than me. It's always the same. I don't know who the best is. Anyway, what we did this year is crazy."
       
       
       Following an exceptional 2025 season, Vitality now carry the burden of being the team to beat, with many rivals expected to make changes in the winter break to challenge their dominance.
       
       But apEX seems unfazed by such potential distractions. His main focus is how he can add to his team's legacy — and his own — as they continue to rewrite the history books.
       
       "The first goal of next year is the back-to-back Grand Slam," he said. "That would be nice. It starts in Krakow, so we already have a big thing for Krakow.
       
       "And then, yeah, going back to the Major in Cologne and trying our best there. It's a good place to win. I've had decent results there every time. Hopefully, maybe a third Major in a row there. Let's see."

       The risk level is currently moderate-to-high as the market enters a post-Major "cool-down" phase and the winter break, which typically triggers profit-taking and lower liquidity despite Vitality's historic dominance.

       While Vitality’s pursuit of a back-to-back Grand Slam in Krakow sustains long-term demand for their items, the immediate saturation of nine trophies in one year suggests a temporary price ceiling for their newest tournament assets.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at break-even with 0% PnL, there is no profit to take or loss to cut, making it a neutral time to hold.
16:19:20 | INFO     |     -> Decision for NIP: HOLD, Reason: 虽然目前持仓处于-2.12%的微弱亏损且情绪评分极低（15/100），但从市场新闻来看，Vitality 队长 apEX 在讨论“史上最伟大战队”时明确提到了 NIP 的历史地位，这再次强化了该品牌作为 CS 史上传奇豪门的长期价值支撑。目前情绪低迷主因是 Major 结束后资金向冠军资产过度集中导致的暂时性流动性缺失。NIP 印花作为具有深厚底蕴的“情怀资产”，在休赛期（Winter Break）往往表现出较强的抗跌性。考虑到交易手续费，此时卖出并不划算。建议继续持有，规避手续费损耗，等待市场热度从冠军炒作中消退后的价值回归。

       After winning his fourth Major, apEX sets new targets
       MIRAA
       18-12-2025 21:30
       Vitality's skipper said his team still needs to claim more silverware before it can be considered the greatest of all time.
       
       
       It took Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire over three years to fulfill his dream of winning a Major as an in-game leader after Vitality offered him the role in January 2020. But in the two and a half years since the title run in Paris, he has added two more Major crowns to his résumé, having guided the team to victory in Austin and Budapest.
       
       With Sunday's win against FaZe at the MVM Dome, apEX joins an exclusive club of players with at least four Major titles (he had won his first in 2015 in Cluj-Napoca while with Envy). Only five other players have achieved that feat, and they were all part of the record-breaking Astralis roster that defined an era. That's great company to have.
       
       "When you win one, you want to be among the IGLs who have won two, and etcetera," apEX told HLTV after the final. "I'm so happy. I have a wonderful team. Wonderful teammates who help me on a daily basis to be the best captain that I can be.
       
       "When I started as an IGL, I didn't expect that one day I'd have four Majors under my belt and three as an IGL. It's crazy."
       
       Each of his three Major titles holds distinct significance. The Paris victory will always have a special place in his heart due to the event's location and the fact that "no one expected us [to win] in a way because we had won only one trophy before."
       
       
       apEX won his first Major as an IGL in 2023 in Paris
       Austin, he said, was the crowning moment of a near-perfect season. As for Budapest, he admitted it is slightly "less impactful" than the other two.
       
       "We were not the favorites, but if people are smart enough, they know that, in the big tournament, the best team of the year can bounce back," he said. "That's what we did."
       
       Vitality's Budapest run caps an incredible year that saw them win nine titles (including the two Majors and IEM Katowice) in addition to a Grand Slam.
       
       The conversation has shifted all of a sudden. It's no longer about whether we're in the Vitality era — that seems to be a given. It has now turned into a greatest-of-all-time debate.

magixx and zont1x return to Spirit roster as chopper and zweih are benched
MIRAA
19-12-2025 00:01
The Russian team is pulling the trigger on changes following a disappointing end to the year.


After a spell on the bench, zont1x and magixx return to Spirit's active roster
Spirit have announced that benched duo Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev and Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia have been brought back into the starting lineup as replacements for Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin.

With chopper's removal from the active roster, the captaincy duties will be handled by magixx, who revealed on HLTV Confirmed back in August that he was open to becoming an in-game leader.

magixx: "I'm looking for any offers, but I don't think there'll be any before the Budapest Major"
The double change comes after a disappointing second half of the season. Spirit found some success after replacing magixx with zweih, winning IEM Cologne and the BLAST Bounty Season 2 Finals, but struggled to find consistency after bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for zont1x, who asked to be moved to the bench due to personal reasons.

In a statement, head coach Sergey "⁠hally⁠" Shavaev explained that, by May, it had become evident that changes would have to be implemented due to what he described as "psychological problems and physical health issues."

"It wasn’t an easy task as there were no ideal candidates that could solve our problems right away," he explained. "So, we came up with a plan. The decision was made to sign two skilled prospects who had shown a lot of promise throughout the previous season.

"It would provide our leaving players with an opportunity to recover, so that we would be able to build the best possible roster at the end of the year.

"This particular approach actually helped us refresh our playstyle and facilitated the adaptation of less-experienced players to tier-1 competition.

"Therefore, by the end of the year we now know more about the newcomers’ actual in-game potential. We have implemented this plan, and you can see the results in today’s announcement."


hally said zweih needs to grow as a player to compete at the highest level and doesn't fit the team, role-wise
Spirit's season came to an end with a semi-final run at the Budapest Major, where they lost to eventual champions Vitality 0-2 after wasting a 12-6 lead on the first map, Mirage.

"It’s important to point out that replacing zweih proved a very difficult decision for us," hally said. "We truly consider him a very talented player and a great teammate. If only it was possible to field more than five players, we’d be happy to keep working with him.

"However, it is pretty obvious that zweih naturally gravitates towards slightly different roles, not the ones we need of him at the moment. Besides, he still needs to mature and become a more complete player to compete at the elite level.

"I sincerely wish him the best career ever. Ivan is young, gifted and smart, he has everything it takes to achieve great things in esports. I’m sure we’ll meet again in and out of the server."

It's the second time that chopper has been moved to the bench since joining Spirit in March 2019. In November 2021, he was placed on the transfer list following a disappointing run at the Stockholm Major, only to be reinstated to the starting lineup three months later.


chopper guided Spirit to a Major win at the end of 2024
The 28-year-old was in the running for the IGL of the Year award at the 2024 HLTV Awards after leading Spirit to victory in four international events, most notably IEM Katowice and the Shanghai Major. He finished runner-up to Natus Vincere's Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen.

"Throughout all these years you have become my closest teammate," hally said of chopper. "Our tandem has brought me so many emotions, and I’m truly grateful to you for the wonderful time we spent on the team.

"I wish you happiness, and let all your dreams come true."

The new-look Spirit roster will make its first appearance in 2026 in BLAST Bounty, which will kick off on January 12 with the online stage, featuring 32 teams.

"Boris [magixx] will have to master a new role, he is to become the captain, but I’m confident that he has what it takes to be among the best in it.

"Miroslav [zont1x] is fully refreshed and will get back to playing his old spots. All in all, we are confident that the current roster has huge potential, the future results depend solely on ourselves."

With these changes, Spirit are now:

Russia Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets
Russia Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov
Belarus Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich
Russia Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev

16:19:31 | INFO     | 1. The market risk is **High**, as the benching of a legendary, Major-winning IGL like chopper creates massive uncertainty regarding Spirit’s tactical stability and future trophy contention.

2. **Sell** chopper stickers immediately to capitalize on the "legacy" price spike typical of veteran benchings, and liquidate zweih assets as his value as a prospect will likely crater without active Tier-1 exposure.

3. **Hold** core donk and sh1ro signatures for long-term stability, while placing speculative **Buy** orders on magixx stickers before the 2026 BLAST season to front-run potential gains from his new role as IGL.

       magixx and zont1x return to Spirit roster as chopper and zweih are benched
       MIRAA
       19-12-2025 00:01
       The Russian team is pulling the trigger on changes following a disappointing end to the year.
       
       
       After a spell on the bench, zont1x and magixx return to Spirit's active roster
       Spirit have announced that benched duo Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev and Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia have been brought back into the starting lineup as replacements for Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin.
       
       With chopper's removal from the active roster, the captaincy duties will be handled by magixx, who revealed on HLTV Confirmed back in August that he was open to becoming an in-game leader.

       magixx: "I'm looking for any offers, but I don't think there'll be any before the Budapest Major"
       The double change comes after a disappointing second half of the season. Spirit found some success after replacing magixx with zweih, winning IEM Cologne and the BLAST Bounty Season 2 Finals, but struggled to find consistency after bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for zont1x, who asked to be moved to the bench due to personal reasons.
       
       In a statement, head coach Sergey "⁠hally⁠" Shavaev explained that, by May, it had become evident that changes would have to be implemented due to what he described as "psychological problems and physical health issues."
       
       "It wasn’t an easy task as there were no ideal candidates that could solve our problems right away," he explained. "So, we came up with a plan. The decision was made to sign two skilled prospects who had shown a lot of promise throughout the previous season.
       
       "It would provide our leaving players with an opportunity to recover, so that we would be able to build the best possible roster at the end of the year.
       
       "This particular approach actually helped us refresh our playstyle and facilitated the adaptation of less-experienced players to tier-1 competition.
       
       "Therefore, by the end of the year we now know more about the newcomers’ actual in-game potential. We have implemented this plan, and you can see the results in today’s announcement."
       
       
       hally said zweih needs to grow as a player to compete at the highest level and doesn't fit the team, role-wise
       Spirit's season came to an end with a semi-final run at the Budapest Major, where they lost to eventual champions Vitality 0-2 after wasting a 12-6 lead on the first map, Mirage.
       
       "It’s important to point out that replacing zweih proved a very difficult decision for us," hally said. "We truly consider him a very talented player and a great teammate. If only it was possible to field more than five players, we’d be happy to keep working with him.
       
       "However, it is pretty obvious that zweih naturally gravitates towards slightly different roles, not the ones we need of him at the moment. Besides, he still needs to mature and become a more complete player to compete at the elite level.
       
       "I sincerely wish him the best career ever. Ivan is young, gifted and smart, he has everything it takes to achieve great things in esports. I’m sure we’ll meet again in and out of the server."
       
       It's the second time that chopper has been moved to the bench since joining Spirit in March 2019. In November 2021, he was placed on the transfer list following a disappointing run at the Stockholm Major, only to be reinstated to the starting lineup three months later.
       
       
       chopper guided Spirit to a Major win at the end of 2024
       The 28-year-old was in the running for the IGL of the Year award at the 2024 HLTV Awards after leading Spirit to victory in four international events, most notably IEM Katowice and the Shanghai Major. He finished runner-up to Natus Vincere's Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen.
       
       "Throughout all these years you have become my closest teammate," hally said of chopper. "Our tandem has brought me so many emotions, and I’m truly grateful to you for the wonderful time we spent on the team.
       
       "I wish you happiness, and let all your dreams come true."
       
       The new-look Spirit roster will make its first appearance in 2026 in BLAST Bounty, which will kick off on January 12 with the online stage, featuring 32 teams.

       Spirit's season came to an end with a semi-final run at the Budapest Major, where they lost to eventual champions Vitality 0-2 after wasting a 12-6 lead on the first map, Mirage.
       
       "It’s important to point out that replacing zweih proved a very difficult decision for us," hally said. "We truly consider him a very talented player and a great teammate. If only it was possible to field more than five players, we’d be happy to keep working with him.
       
       "However, it is pretty obvious that zweih naturally gravitates towards slightly different roles, not the ones we need of him at the moment. Besides, he still needs to mature and become a more complete player to compete at the elite level.

       It's the second time that chopper has been moved to the bench since joining Spirit in March 2019. In November 2021, he was placed on the transfer list following a disappointing run at the Stockholm Major, only to be reinstated to the starting lineup three months later.

       magixx and zont1x return to Spirit roster as chopper and zweih are benched
       MIRAA
       19-12-2025 00:01
       The Russian team is pulling the trigger on changes following a disappointing end to the year.
       
       
       After a spell on the bench, zont1x and magixx return to Spirit's active roster
       Spirit have announced that benched duo Boris "⁠magixx⁠" Vorobiev and Myroslav "⁠zont1x⁠" Plakhotia have been brought back into the starting lineup as replacements for Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin.
       
       With chopper's removal from the active roster, the captaincy duties will be handled by magixx, who revealed on HLTV Confirmed back in August that he was open to becoming an in-game leader.

       magixx: "I'm looking for any offers, but I don't think there'll be any before the Budapest Major"
       The double change comes after a disappointing second half of the season. Spirit found some success after replacing magixx with zweih, winning IEM Cologne and the BLAST Bounty Season 2 Finals, but struggled to find consistency after bringing in Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich for zont1x, who asked to be moved to the bench due to personal reasons.
       
       In a statement, head coach Sergey "⁠hally⁠" Shavaev explained that, by May, it had become evident that changes would have to be implemented due to what he described as "psychological problems and physical health issues."
       
       "It wasn’t an easy task as there were no ideal candidates that could solve our problems right away," he explained. "So, we came up with a plan. The decision was made to sign two skilled prospects who had shown a lot of promise throughout the previous season.
       
       "It would provide our leaving players with an opportunity to recover, so that we would be able to build the best possible roster at the end of the year.

HLTV Awards: Team of the Year finalists revealed
king_dempz
20-12-2025 02:00
Three teams stood out from the rest across 2025.


With the conclusion of Counter-Strike's competitive year comes time to crown the best of that year, the players and teams that elevated themselves above the competition and delivered in a way that deserves recognition.

One of the most coveted awards on the docket for the HLTV Awards is the Team of the Year award, which recognizes the squad that outperformed the rest to claim the year as their own, as teams like Natus Vincere, FaZe and Vitality have done in the past.

In 2025 there were a number of teams that made serious efforts to put their names forward as potential considerations for the Team of the Year award, with seven different teams winning Big Event trophies across the year.

Spirit, Vitality, MOUZ, Falcons, G2, The MongolZ and FURIA all etched their names onto at least one Big Event trophy across the year, thus at the very least putting themselves in the conversation. Three teams, however, stood out above the rest.

Team of the Year finalists

Europe MOUZ
MOUZ are a case study in consistency. After a slow start to 2025 as they swapped Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek for Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi, the European combine returned to their consistently elite form, winning PGL Bucharest before bagging top-four or top-two finishes all the way to, and including, BLAST.tv Austin Major.

MOUZ continued their incredible streak of deep finishes up to BLAST Bounty Season 2, bringing their run to nine top-four placements in a row. By the end of the year MOUZ had 13 top-four finishes to their name, and had finished at least top-eight in every single event since PGL Bucharest.

Russia Spirit
Spirit's year was one of strong highs. Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and his side kicked off 2025 with a bang, winning the first event of the year at BLAST Bounty Season 1, before going on to emphasise their status as an elite squad by picking up second at IEM Katowice and more titles.

The addition of Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin after a playoff run at the Austin Major did little to slow Spirit down in the short term, and they bagged two more trophies, one notably coming at IEM Cologne. Although Spirit's consistency waned somewhat as the second half of the year wore on, the Russian side performed admirably at StarLadder Budapest Major, adding a top-four finish to their resume.

Europe Vitality
What is there to say about Vitality's year that hasn't already been said? Their first season of the year was one that will go down in history as perhaps the best run of form any team has ever experienced, as they secured seven event wins on the bounce, one being BLAST.tv Austin Major, and racked up an incredible series winstreak in the process.

Upon their return from the player break Vitality continued their impeccable streak of top tournament placings. Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire's squad finished no lower than fourth in any event and added two more titles to their ever-growing trophy cabinet, ESL Pro League Season 22 and the all-important StarLadder Budapest Major, capping the year with the first back-to-back Major title since 2019.

       HLTV Awards: Team of the Year finalists revealed
       king_dempz
       20-12-2025 02:00
       Three teams stood out from the rest across 2025.
       
       
       With the conclusion of Counter-Strike's competitive year comes time to crown the best of that year, the players and teams that elevated themselves above the competition and delivered in a way that deserves recognition.
       
       One of the most coveted awards on the docket for the HLTV Awards is the Team of the Year award, which recognizes the squad that outperformed the rest to claim the year as their own, as teams like Natus Vincere, FaZe and Vitality have done in the past.
       
       In 2025 there were a number of teams that made serious efforts to put their names forward as potential considerations for the Team of the Year award, with seven different teams winning Big Event trophies across the year.
       
       Spirit, Vitality, MOUZ, Falcons, G2, The MongolZ and FURIA all etched their names onto at least one Big Event trophy across the year, thus at the very least putting themselves in the conversation. Three teams, however, stood out above the rest.
       
       Team of the Year finalists
       
       Europe MOUZ
       MOUZ are a case study in consistency. After a slow start to 2025 as they swapped Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek for Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi, the European combine returned to their consistently elite form, winning PGL Bucharest before bagging top-four or top-two finishes all the way to, and including, BLAST.tv Austin Major.
       
       MOUZ continued their incredible streak of deep finishes up to BLAST Bounty Season 2, bringing their run to nine top-four placements in a row. By the end of the year MOUZ had 13 top-four finishes to their name, and had finished at least top-eight in every single event since PGL Bucharest.
       
       Russia Spirit
       Spirit's year was one of strong highs. Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and his side kicked off 2025 with a bang, winning the first event of the year at BLAST Bounty Season 1, before going on to emphasise their status as an elite squad by picking up second at IEM Katowice and more titles.
       
       The addition of Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin after a playoff run at the Austin Major did little to slow Spirit down in the short term, and they bagged two more trophies, one notably coming at IEM Cologne. Although Spirit's consistency waned somewhat as the second half of the year wore on, the Russian side performed admirably at StarLadder Budapest Major, adding a top-four finish to their resume.
       
       Europe Vitality
       What is there to say about Vitality's year that hasn't already been said? Their first season of the year was one that will go down in history as perhaps the best run of form any team has ever experienced, as they secured seven event wins on the bounce, one being BLAST.tv Austin Major, and racked up an incredible series winstreak in the process.
       
       Upon their return from the player break Vitality continued their impeccable streak of top tournament placings. Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire's squad finished no lower than fourth in any event and added two more titles to their ever-growing trophy cabinet, ESL Pro League Season 22 and the all-important StarLadder Budapest Major, capping the year with the first back-to-back Major title since 2019.
       
       
       Short news: Week 51
       Keep up with more Counter-Strike in bite-sized pieces.

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently down 6.33%, taking profit is not an option; you should consider cutting your loss if you anticipate a further decline in value.
16:21:40 | INFO     |     -> Decision for The MongolZ: HOLD, Reason: 当前价格处于 0.02 的买入成本价，盈亏比例为 0.00%。由于交易平台通常收取 10%-15% 的手续费，此时卖出将面临实质性的资金亏损。市场新闻中提到 The MongolZ 在 2025 年曾赢得过 Big Event 冠军，并被列入年度最佳战队的讨论范围，这证明了该品牌印花具备坚实的基本面和历史价值支撑。今日情绪评分回升至 55/100，显示市场信心稳健。在价格处于保本线且品牌价值得到官方认可的情况下，持有是规避手续费磨损、等待未来赛事利好的最佳策略。

       With the asset at its minimum price floor and zero profit, hold for future appreciation since there is no gain to realize and negligible downside risk.

       In 2025 there were a number of teams that made serious efforts to put their names forward as potential considerations for the Team of the Year award, with seven different teams winning Big Event trophies across the year.
       
       Spirit, Vitality, MOUZ, Falcons, G2, The MongolZ and FURIA all etched their names onto at least one Big Event trophy across the year, thus at the very least putting themselves in the conversation. Three teams, however, stood out above the rest.
       
       Team of the Year finalists
       
       Europe MOUZ
       MOUZ are a case study in consistency. After a slow start to 2025 as they swapped Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek for Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi, the European combine returned to their consistently elite form, winning PGL Bucharest before bagging top-four or top-two finishes all the way to, and including, BLAST.tv Austin Major.
       
       MOUZ continued their incredible streak of deep finishes up to BLAST Bounty Season 2, bringing their run to nine top-four placements in a row. By the end of the year MOUZ had 13 top-four finishes to their name, and had finished at least top-eight in every single event since PGL Bucharest.
       
       Russia Spirit
       Spirit's year was one of strong highs. Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and his side kicked off 2025 with a bang, winning the first event of the year at BLAST Bounty Season 1, before going on to emphasise their status as an elite squad by picking up second at IEM Katowice and more titles.
       
       The addition of Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin after a playoff run at the Austin Major did little to slow Spirit down in the short term, and they bagged two more trophies, one notably coming at IEM Cologne. Although Spirit's consistency waned somewhat as the second half of the year wore on, the Russian side performed admirably at StarLadder Budapest Major, adding a top-four finish to their resume.
       
       Europe Vitality
       What is there to say about Vitality's year that hasn't already been said? Their first season of the year was one that will go down in history as perhaps the best run of form any team has ever experienced, as they secured seven event wins on the bounce, one being BLAST.tv Austin Major, and racked up an incredible series winstreak in the process.
       
       Upon their return from the player break Vitality continued their impeccable streak of top tournament placings. Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire's squad finished no lower than fourth in any event and added two more titles to their ever-growing trophy cabinet, ESL Pro League Season 22 and the all-important StarLadder Budapest Major, capping the year with the first back-to-back Major title since 2019.

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       Vitality’s historic dominance, including back-to-back Major titles and seven consecutive event wins, has likely driven their sticker valuations to a speculative ceiling ahead of the HLTV Awards. The market risk level is **Moderate-High**, as the current hype surrounding Team of the Year finalists often precedes a "sell the news" correction during the year-end player break. My recommendation is to **HOLD** Vitality and MOUZ stickers to capture the final awards-season premium, but **SELL** Spirit and mid-tier winners like FURIA or Falcons to liquidate positions before the January volume dip.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since you are currently at a 13.34% deficit, you should consider cutting your losses to preserve capital, as taking profit is not an option at this price.
16:22:00 | INFO     |     -> Decision for gla1ve: HOLD, Reason: 市场新闻中出现重大利好：传奇指挥官 gla1ve 已确认离开 ENCE，并正式宣布转型教练，据报道即将加入 100 Thieves。同时，rain 也公开表示在 gla1ve 的辅佐下转型 IGL 是“梦想成真”。这一系列动态让 gla1ve 再次成为全市场的焦点，今日情绪评分已从低谷大幅跃升至 78/100。虽然目前账面仅有 0.25% 的微弱盈余，但利好消息刚刚开始发酵。在转会洗牌期（Roster Shuffle）热度正盛且个人新闻价值爆发的阶段，建议继续持有，博取正式官宣后的价格冲高，避免在行情启动初期因手续费损耗而离场。

       HLTV Awards: Team of the Year finalists revealed

       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Hold the asset, as a 0.25% gain is too marginal to cover transaction fees and suggests it is better to wait for a more significant price movement.
16:22:09 | INFO     |     -> Decision for NiKo: HOLD, Reason: 虽然目前处于盈亏平衡点（0.00%），但考虑到交易平台的手续费（通常为 10%-15%），此时卖出将导致实质性的资金净亏损。今日情绪评分 40/100 处于低位，反映出市场关注度目前集中在 HLTV 年度战队的评选以及 gla1ve 转型等爆炸性转会新闻上。NiKo 作为 CS2 饰品市场的顶级蓝筹资产，其价值在即将到来的冬季转会洗牌期（Roster Shuffle）极易产生新的转会传闻或战队重组利好。建议继续持有，规避手续费磨损，等待市场资金从年度奖项炒作中轮动回流至传奇选手资产。

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       Vitality’s historic dominance, including back-to-back Major titles and seven consecutive event wins, has likely driven their sticker valuations to a speculative ceiling ahead of the HLTV Awards. The market risk level is **Moderate-High**, as the current hype surrounding Team of the Year finalists often precedes a "sell the news" correction during the year-end player break. My recommendation is to **HOLD** Vitality and MOUZ stickers to capture the final awards-season premium, but **SELL** Spirit and mid-tier winners like FURIA or Falcons to liquidate positions before the January volume dip.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Since the asset is currently at break-even, it is best to hold until a clear price trend emerges or you identify a better investment opportunity.
16:22:20 | INFO     |     -> Decision for device: HOLD, Reason: 当前价格处于买入成本价（600.0），盈亏比例为 0.00%。考虑到交易平台通常存在 10%-15% 的手续费，此时卖出将面临实质性亏损。市场新闻中，gla1ve 转型教练并可能加入 100 Thieves 的爆炸性消息再次让人们联想到 Astralis 的传奇时代，device 作为该时代的核心人物，其品牌溢价和收藏价值得到了侧面巩固。尽管今日情绪评分较低（35/100），反映出 Major 后的市场冷静期，但作为蓝筹选手资产，其抗跌性极强。建议继续持有，规避手续费损耗，并等待市场资金从年度奖项炒作转移回传奇选手资产时带来的价值回归。

       HLTV Awards: Team of the Year finalists revealed
       king_dempz
       20-12-2025 02:00
       Three teams stood out from the rest across 2025.
       
       
       With the conclusion of Counter-Strike's competitive year comes time to crown the best of that year, the players and teams that elevated themselves above the competition and delivered in a way that deserves recognition.
       
       One of the most coveted awards on the docket for the HLTV Awards is the Team of the Year award, which recognizes the squad that outperformed the rest to claim the year as their own, as teams like Natus Vincere, FaZe and Vitality have done in the past.
       
       In 2025 there were a number of teams that made serious efforts to put their names forward as potential considerations for the Team of the Year award, with seven different teams winning Big Event trophies across the year.
       
       Spirit, Vitality, MOUZ, Falcons, G2, The MongolZ and FURIA all etched their names onto at least one Big Event trophy across the year, thus at the very least putting themselves in the conversation. Three teams, however, stood out above the rest.
       
       Team of the Year finalists
       
       Europe MOUZ
       MOUZ are a case study in consistency. After a slow start to 2025 as they swapped Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek for Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi, the European combine returned to their consistently elite form, winning PGL Bucharest before bagging top-four or top-two finishes all the way to, and including, BLAST.tv Austin Major.
       
       MOUZ continued their incredible streak of deep finishes up to BLAST Bounty Season 2, bringing their run to nine top-four placements in a row. By the end of the year MOUZ had 13 top-four finishes to their name, and had finished at least top-eight in every single event since PGL Bucharest.
       
       Russia Spirit
       Spirit's year was one of strong highs. Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and his side kicked off 2025 with a bang, winning the first event of the year at BLAST Bounty Season 1, before going on to emphasise their status as an elite squad by picking up second at IEM Katowice and more titles.
       
       The addition of Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin after a playoff run at the Austin Major did little to slow Spirit down in the short term, and they bagged two more trophies, one notably coming at IEM Cologne. Although Spirit's consistency waned somewhat as the second half of the year wore on, the Russian side performed admirably at StarLadder Budapest Major, adding a top-four finish to their resume.
       
       Europe Vitality
       What is there to say about Vitality's year that hasn't already been said? Their first season of the year was one that will go down in history as perhaps the best run of form any team has ever experienced, as they secured seven event wins on the bounce, one being BLAST.tv Austin Major, and racked up an incredible series winstreak in the process.
       
       Upon their return from the player break Vitality continued their impeccable streak of top tournament placings. Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire's squad finished no lower than fourth in any event and added two more titles to their ever-growing trophy cabinet, ESL Pro League Season 22 and the all-important StarLadder Budapest Major, capping the year with the first back-to-back Major title since 2019.

       With a 0% return, there is currently no profit to take or loss to cut.
16:22:31 | INFO     |     -> Decision for NIP: HOLD, Reason: 虽然目前持仓处于 -7.41% 的亏损状态，且今日情绪评分极低（15/100），反映出 Major 结束后市场对非活跃战队的关注度降至冰点。但在 CS2 饰品交易中，10%-15% 的平台手续费意味着此时卖出将面临巨大的实质性双位数亏损。市场新闻中提到 NIP 在 2025 年曾赢得过 Big Event 冠军，这证明了该品牌作为传统豪门在当下依然具备竞技实力和品牌底蕴。在没有直接利空消息的情况下，建议继续持有以规避手续费磨损，并博取未来新赛季开启前市场对传统蓝筹印花的热度回归。

       Since you are currently at a loss, taking profit is not an option, and you should consider cutting your loss if the price drops further or if the asset's fundamentals have weakened.
16:22:50 | INFO     |     -> Decision for Natus Vincere 布达佩斯 2025: SELL, Reason: 尽管今日情绪评分高达 80/100，但该印花在短短 7 天内跌幅高达 54.43%，显示出极其严重的泡沫破裂和过度投机后的价值回归。根据金融分析报告，NAVI 未能进入 HLTV 年度最佳战队决赛名单，失去了奖项季的溢价支撑。目前市场资金正高度集中在 Vitality 和 MOUZ 等获奖热门战队上。考虑到 1 月份通常会出现市场成交量萎缩和价格修正，继续持有亏损过半的资产风险极大。作为专业交易员，应果断止损以保住剩余的 45% 本金，并将其转向更具动能的资产，避免在冬季休赛期的低流动性中进一步阴跌。

       --- Financial Analyst Report ---
       Vitality’s historic dominance, including back-to-back Major titles and seven consecutive event wins, has likely driven their sticker valuations to a speculative ceiling ahead of the HLTV Awards. The market risk level is **Moderate-High**, as the current hype surrounding Team of the Year finalists often precedes a "sell the news" correction during the year-end player break. My recommendation is to **HOLD** Vitality and MOUZ stickers to capture the final awards-season premium, but **SELL** Spirit and mid-tier winners like FURIA or Falcons to liquidate positions before the January volume dip.
       --- Item Price Analysis ---
       Cut your losses now to preserve your remaining capital, as the asset has depreciated by over 54% and there is no profit to take.
