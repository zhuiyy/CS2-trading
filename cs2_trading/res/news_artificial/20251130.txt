Short: FACEIT's Leagues Manager clarifies rule on orgs with multiple teams competing in ESEA
Since the restructuring of the ESEA league system, some confusion has arisen around the rules surrounding organizations with multiple teams, for example a main team and an academy or female team.

ESEA League reworked to once again be path to ESL Challenger League
A question was raised on whether academy teams could compete in ESEA if they were in the same region as their main team.


HLTV contacted FACEIT's Leagues & Tournaments Product Manager, Kamil "r00cky" Plichta, for clarification. The rule only applies to teams competing in Open up to Advanced, so if your main team is in ECL or EPL, you are not violating the rules.

"You need to treat eg Advanced-Open9-10 as one pool of teams (or in valve terms, one competition)," Kamil said. "Meaning that two teams, eg FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED cannot both participate in groups between Advanced and Open9-10.

"I think an easy way to explain it is how VRS invites work, using the same example, if FlyQuest and FlyQuest RED both get the invitation to a single event, only one can accept the invite."
