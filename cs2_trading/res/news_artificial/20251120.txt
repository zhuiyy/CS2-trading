The Danish IGL is reportedly on the brink of joining a new team after a month on the bench.


Chr1zN is reportedly replacing LNZ as HEROIC's IGL
OG benched IGL Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard is close to joining HEROIC to replace Linus "⁠LNZ⁠" Holtäng as the team's new skipper, according to a report from Sheep Esports.

Chr1zN was moved to the bench in October alongside Nico "⁠nicoodoz⁠" Tamjidi as the team decided to shake things up after missing out on a spot at the Budapest Major. OG went on to sign Casper "⁠cadiaN⁠" Møller, who is returning to the combined role of AWP and IGL that has brought him much success in the past.

LNZ has been with HEROIC since January, when the Norwegian organization signed Sangal's core. The team won the MESA Nomadic Masters Spring and advanced to Stage 2 of the Austin Major, but recent results have been mixed — a run of form that culminated in the team failing to enter the qualification zone for the Budapest Major.

On HEROIC, Chr1zN will reunite with Tobias "⁠TOBIZ⁠" Theo, who coached him during his nearly two-year spell on MOUZ NXT.

HEROIC have yet to make a decision on Alimzhan "⁠Alkaren⁠" Bitimbay, who joined the team in August on loan from Spirit. The 18-year-old AWPer has struggled for form at the highest level, averaging a 1.03 rating while with the team.

Should Chr1zN's transfer go through, HEROIC will have:

Denmark Christoffer "⁠Chr1zN⁠" Storgaard
Sweden Linus "⁠nilo⁠" Bergman
Sweden Simon "⁠yxngstxr⁠" Boije
Turkey Yasin "⁠xfl0ud⁠" Koç
Kazakhstan Alimzhan "⁠Alkaren⁠" Bitimbay (loan)
