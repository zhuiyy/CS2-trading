The French organization caps off a fantastic 2025 as the first team to win back-to-back Majors since Astralis in 2019.


Vitality "put the cherry on top of the cake" of their phenomenal 2025 by beating FaZe 3-1 in the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Major crowns since Astralis in 2019.

flameZ: "Now it's just about putting the cherry on top of the cake"
FaZe raced out of the gate on Nuke (6-13), where Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut struggled and Vitality looked a shadow of themselves, but tactical supremacy by Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire on Dust2 (13-3), Inferno (13-9), and Overpass (13-2) saw Vitality romp to the trophy with ease in the first-ever best-of-five Major final.

It was a statement victory for the French organization after a muted Fall season, where they won a single title at ESL Pro League Season 22 despite always finishing fourth or better at every event, including two runners-up places at IEM Chengdu and BLAST Open London.

That is considered a "muted" season only because it stands in stark contrast to the most dominant season of Counter-Strike ever seen, one where Vitality won seven titles, 30 matches, and 37 series, all in a row.


Clip: Vitality lift the trophy

To close out 2025 with a second Major title crushes any doubt about whether Vitality have had a year worthy of an era, and means apEX now ties Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif, Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander, and Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth for total Majors won, second only to Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen with five.

"The best team of all time used to be Astralis, they won ten [trophies] and one Major in the same year," apEX said in a post-match interview. "We did nine, but two Majors.

"I don’t know who’s better, but we accomplished something incredible this year, something I didn’t expect possible... dupreeh, I’m coming for you."

ZywOo walking away with the MVP award also puts him in a class of his own as the only player to have three Major MVP medals to his name, and the second player ever to win back-to-back Major medals in the same year after Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David in 2016.


Clip: ZywOo humbles FaZe with 4k on Long

Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool, who has been in every single CS2 Major final, walks away with his third Major trophy after beating the very team he departed at the end of 2024, a year which ended with a heartbreaking loss to Spirit in the grand final of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. The Estonian rifler sealed his team's victory by tallying the best-ever map of his career on Overpass, recording a 22-7 K-D, 144.1 ADR, +18.78 Round Swing, and 2.89 rating.


"I'm speechless, really tired," ropz said after the game. "I had the worst sleep today. I barely ate. A lot of stress, coming in against FaZe. For me it's special to play them, maybe for them it's not as much, they have some history with me. It was a special day, hard to come into this match, I'm happy we came away with it."

FaZe all but needed a Nuke win to make challenging Vitality in the final a reality, but it was the fashion in which that win came that gave hope for a competitive match.

Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken set the tone early doors, going up 11-2 after a triple in the pistol and a double to crack open A off of FaZe's famous 'Canada' strategy. That breakneck pace saw Vitality largely outclassed on the defense, with ZywOo noticeably struggling after he missed several key shots and failed trade opportunities.

Jakub "⁠jcobbb⁠" Pietruszewski knocked down three with a Deagle to rob a round in the first half, and his pistol impact came through again after the swap with another triple kill to extend FaZe's lead to 10-4.

Vitality's offense lacked as much punch as their defense lacked poise, and the second half was one dominated by Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen. The Dane found two key triple kills, including one from a 2v3 with an MP9 where Vitality went back Lobby despite taking A, and ended FaZe's CT effort atop the board with a 2.90 defensive rating, 158 ADR, and +15.04 Round Swing.

That map one win was the only time FaZe truly looked competitive in the series, however, with Vitality striking back with a vengeance on Dust2 to show exactly why their record on the map was 30-4 in 2025 going into the series.

A masterclass in calling from apEX saw Vitality abuse FaZe's early information plays and walk into the B site late-round, and they were up 9-1 off the back of clutches from Shahar "⁠flameZ⁠" Shushan and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman before FaZe got a look in. ZywOo was back to his best and ended the map with a quad-kill to top the server, and Vitality's dominance continued on Inferno.

mezii put on a masterclass and ropz was nigh immovable in Pit as FaZe's offense struggled for purchase, their 0-3 start evaporating as mezii added two clutches to bring his tally in the grand final to five total.

A late push from FaZe in the second half fell apart as they found themselves crushed in Banana round after round, excellent calling from apEX leaving no room for a comeback and mezii topping the board with a 2.00 rating, seven multi-kills, and a 23-8 K-D.

Any hope of a competitive series fizzled out on Overpass as Vitality ravaged FaZe's weak B bombsite round after round, mounting a near flawless T side for an 11 round spree before FaZe denied the 13-0 just before the swap. A pistol win from FaZe was wasted as Vitality immediately answered with a force-buy, and sealed their Major victory the round after.

FaZe bullshit reaches its limit
FaZe, if you hadn't already heard, were 0.4 seconds away from elimination at the hands of RED Canids in Stage 1. karrigan's men rebounded with incredible tenacity as the Major wore on, however, going 3-0 through Stage 2, starting Stage 3 with a best-of-one win over Vitality, and beating MOUZ and Natus Vincere in playoffs en route to the grand final.

It was a magical run, defined by "FaZe bullshit" rounds that saw the team turn maps and near-elimination situations time and time again, but that bag of bullshit was emptied out by the time the final came around against a nigh-unstoppable Vitality.


It is not a harrowing loss, though, especially for a team that brought in rookie jcobbb just three months prior and saw him start to flourish as the tournament went on. A particularly difficult year bereft of titles thus ends on a high, and karrigan made that clear after the match.

"One month ago we were in the worst situation, 1 month of grinding and fighting every day to stay alive, incredible stress all these weeks," he said on X.

"I’m insanely proud of my team, today we couldn’t push anymore, worst year of my career but we went all the day to the major final."

ZywOo earns historic third Major MVP at StarLadder Budapest

Greater contributions to round wins saw ZywOo take his eighth MVP of 2025 in a tight race with teammate ropz.


Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut has earned a historic third Major Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after helping Vitality win back-to-back Majors at StarLadder Budapest 2025.

The hat-trick of medals puts ZywOo beyond Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz as the only player with three gold MVPs. He is also the first player since coldzera in 2016 to win two Major MVPs in a single year.

It also takes the Frenchman's 2025 total to eight to match Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev's tally from 2021 (though only four of the Ukrainian's were at Big Events).

When we filter to only Big Events, eight MVPs this year from ZywOo means he is the record holder for most medals in a single year, with this Budapest MVP taking him past device's tally of seven in 2018.

Unlike most of ZywOo's 28 MVPs, there was a real fight for the MVP medal from teammates Robin "⁠ropz⁠" Kool and William "⁠mezii⁠" Merriman.

ropz, in particular, had a shout for the award after a starring role on Mirage against Spirit in semis and by posting his highest-ever rating (2.89) on Overpass on map four against FaZe in the grand final.

After that Overpass, ratings were razor-tight between ZywOo and ropz overall (1.38, 1.37), in playoffs (both 1.40), and in map wins (1.46, 1.47).

Most MVPs in a calendar year:
France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 8 (8)

Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2021: 8 (4 Big Events)

Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 7 (7)

Ukraine Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev, 2018: 6 (5)

France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2020: 6 (0)

Sweden Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, 2013: 6

The tiebreaker, in the end, was kills per round win which had ZywOo firmly in the lead.

Over the entire event, ZywOo averaged 1.17 KPRW, while ropz was on 1.02 and mezii, the best player of the final overall, had just 0.92. In playoffs, ZywOo's gap is even larger at 1.19 KPRW with ropz on 0.96.

Even over the semi and the final (where ropz does have a rating gap to ZywOo), the team's AWPer boasts 1.08 KPRW vs ropz's 0.95.

Most MVPs at Majors:
France Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut, 2025: 3

Brazil Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, 2025: 2

Denmark Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz, 2018: 2

With ZywOo in the lead before the final, ropz needed to have a significantly better championship Sunday to snatch the medal at the death. And, despite how good ropz's record-breaking map on Overpass was, it is hard to conclusively prove that was the case for the final overall after the Estonian posted 14-16, 10-9, and 14-14 K-D statlines on the first three maps.

That, ultimately, meant ZywOo stayed ahead to win the MVP. Both players, however, will receive similarly plentiful deposits of credit in the bank for decisions relating to the Top 20 Players of the Year from their exploits in Hungary.
