Three teams stood out from the rest across 2025.


With the conclusion of Counter-Strike's competitive year comes time to crown the best of that year, the players and teams that elevated themselves above the competition and delivered in a way that deserves recognition.

One of the most coveted awards on the docket for the HLTV Awards is the Team of the Year award, which recognizes the squad that outperformed the rest to claim the year as their own, as teams like Natus Vincere, FaZe and Vitality have done in the past.

In 2025 there were a number of teams that made serious efforts to put their names forward as potential considerations for the Team of the Year award, with seven different teams winning Big Event trophies across the year.

Spirit, Vitality, MOUZ, Falcons, G2, The MongolZ and FURIA all etched their names onto at least one Big Event trophy across the year, thus at the very least putting themselves in the conversation. Three teams, however, stood out above the rest.

Team of the Year finalists

Europe MOUZ
MOUZ are a case study in consistency. After a slow start to 2025 as they swapped Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek for Lotan "⁠Spinx⁠" Giladi, the European combine returned to their consistently elite form, winning PGL Bucharest before bagging top-four or top-two finishes all the way to, and including, BLAST.tv Austin Major.

MOUZ continued their incredible streak of deep finishes up to BLAST Bounty Season 2, bringing their run to nine top-four placements in a row. By the end of the year MOUZ had 13 top-four finishes to their name, and had finished at least top-eight in every single event since PGL Bucharest.

Russia Spirit
Spirit's year was one of strong highs. Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and his side kicked off 2025 with a bang, winning the first event of the year at BLAST Bounty Season 1, before going on to emphasise their status as an elite squad by picking up second at IEM Katowice and more titles.

The addition of Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin after a playoff run at the Austin Major did little to slow Spirit down in the short term, and they bagged two more trophies, one notably coming at IEM Cologne. Although Spirit's consistency waned somewhat as the second half of the year wore on, the Russian side performed admirably at StarLadder Budapest Major, adding a top-four finish to their resume.

Europe Vitality
What is there to say about Vitality's year that hasn't already been said? Their first season of the year was one that will go down in history as perhaps the best run of form any team has ever experienced, as they secured seven event wins on the bounce, one being BLAST.tv Austin Major, and racked up an incredible series winstreak in the process.

Upon their return from the player break Vitality continued their impeccable streak of top tournament placings. Dan "⁠apEX⁠" Madesclaire's squad finished no lower than fourth in any event and added two more titles to their ever-growing trophy cabinet, ESL Pro League Season 22 and the all-important StarLadder Budapest Major, capping the year with the first back-to-back Major title since 2019.
