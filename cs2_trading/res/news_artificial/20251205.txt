Rumors point to Inner Circle's cairne as a possible substitute.


Michel "⁠ewjerkz⁠" Pinto is nearing the end of his time as a starter in Ninjas in Pyjamas according to a report from RTP Arena, which HLTV has backed with its own sources.

The news comes after Ninjas in Pyjamas's run to the StarLadder Budapest Major, where not only did the Marco "⁠Snappi⁠" Pfeiffer-led squad qualify for the Valve-backed event, but made it to the Stage 2 and even went 2-0 before losing three straight best-of-threes in the second Swiss group.

The Portuguese player has been in Ninjas in Pyjamas's books since the beginning of the year and was instrumental in the European team's climb through the VRS system to reach the aforementioned Major, posting a 1.08 rating during his time as a Ninja.

Other than first and second places at Fragadelphia events in the hunt for VRS points, ewjerkz contributed to reaching the quarter-finals at PGL Astana and a run to the final at StarLadder StarSeries Fall 2025 among his best finishes with Ninjas in Pyjamas.

RTP Arena cites rumors of Artem "⁠cairne⁠" Mushynskyi being the player who could substitute ewjerkz in Ninjas in Pyjamas's starting five in 2026. The Ukrainian 23-year-old has had a breakout year with Inner Circle, posting a 1.20 rating in the Ukrainian team's rise from obscurity and shining alongside 18-year-old prospect David "⁠Dawy⁠" Bibik.

This move will put an end to Portuguese representation in Ninjas in Pyjamas for now, which started at the beginning of the year when ewjerkz and countryman Rafael "⁠arrozdoce⁠" Wing joined the team after breaking out on the international scene with SAW in 2023 and 2024.
