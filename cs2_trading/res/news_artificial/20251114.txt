"I have found a new home in 100 Thieves and a new and exciting challenge is about to start," rain said in a post on X. "A lot of work to be done but will do everything I can to get back to the top!"

It is currently unclear who will join rain on 100 Thieves to fill out the roster. CS insider Aleksei "⁠OverDrive⁠" Birukov recently reported that the organization was targeting GamerLegion's core, and whilst GamerLegion's CEO acknowledged a conversation was had with 100 Thieves, he said there were "no active discussions about selling any players or core."

The move marks rain's first new team since January 2016 when he first joined FaZe. During his nearly 10-year stint on FaZe he won numerous trophies including a Major, an Intel Grand Slam, and was names on HLTV's Top 20 Players list multiple times.

The tenured rifler was recently moved to the bench by FaZe to make room for the shock return of Russel "⁠Twistzz⁠" Van Dulken. It is not clear what role rain will undertake on 100 Thieves, but in his statement following his benching by FaZe he indicated a willingness to move into the IGL role.

The apEX-led squad will face Falcons in the semis on Saturday.


Vitality make it four out of four against Spirit in 2025
Vitality and Spirit squared off in the BLAST Rivals Season 2 quarter-finals in their first match since the summer break, with the international squad leading 3-0 in head-to-head matches since the beginning of the year.

This time around, Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut and company were taken to the brink to improve their record against Spirit to 4-0 and secure a spot in the semis against Falcons, as they had to win two maps in overtime after losing the opener 11-13.

The match kicked off on Spirit's Dust2 pick, and the seeds for an exciting series were planted from the start after a chaotic first pistol round ended with a Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets teamkill and the clock expiring. Vitality took advantage and got off to a 5-1 lead, but Spirit activated to bring it even at the half, spearheaded by Andrey "⁠tN1R⁠" Tatarinovich.

In the end, though, it was donk and Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov who topped the board with 1.32 and 1.31 ratings, respectively, with the former getting three opening kills in the final round of regulation to edge the map in Spirit's favor, 13-11.

Nuke was an equally tight map with plenty of highlights going both ways. The most crucial was a highlight-of-the-year contender by donk, who clutched a 1vs5 with a Galil when up against map point to get his team into overtime.

It was in vain in the end as two overtimes later Vitality won 19-16 to take the series to the Mirage decider as the Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin and Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov duo struggled on the CT side and even donk's attempts to assist on the A site didn't bear fruit.

Like the two first maps, the decider went down to the wire. Once again Vitality got an early jump with a 6-1 lead on the CT side, but donk multi-kills got Spirit clawing back all the way back to 10-10.

"donk is a lot, but not always enough," is how Conner "⁠Scrawny⁠" Girvan put it after Vitality won a a dominating A execute to hit map point on the Mirage decider, but Spirit fought back to force overtime with a beautiful triple hold on A by zweih, who had been faltering up to that point.

Finally, Vitality kicked into gear in extra rounds winning three in a row and positioning themselves to take the series, which they did two rounds after the switch to secure their progression in Hong Kong.
