zweih powers up to lead Spirit to Budapest Major semis

In his first-ever Major playoffs match, Spirit's anchor dominated Nuke and powered his team to a late Dust2 comeback.


Spirit overcame Falcons 2-0 to advance to the StarLadder Budapest Major semi-finals.

Ivan "⁠zweih⁠" Gogin powered up with his second-highest rating on LAN ever to lead the Russian side to a dominant win on the Nuke opener, and recovered from a bad start to Dust2 as Spirit came back from 5-11 to win in overtime.

In a testament to his high-impact performance, zweih recorded two aces at crucial points of the game. One came in a confident Lobby push on Nuke to give Spirit an 8-4 defensive half, and the other in a solo defense of the B bombsite on Dust2, where he had been left on an island all half long and struggled just before.



"I got some impact words from hally and chopper before the game, and I stopped feeling the pressure I felt in the last half of a year," he said after the match. "I think I showed how I can really play."

A curse is lifted
Going into the Budapest quarter-final, this core of Spirit had met Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač and Ilya "⁠m0NESY⁠" Osipov nine times in 16 months without a single win to their name.

After only winning three of 22 maps in the matchup against the duo in their time with G2 and Falcons, the curse is finally broken at the tenth time of asking, in no small part thanks to Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets who finally found the recipe against the duo he had struggled so much against.

Alongside zweih, donk was the ever-present force as he kept Spirit competitive enough on Dust2 to give the rest of the team time to show up around him.

He complemented his fantastic group stage performance with another massive showing in the quarter-final, and now averages a 1.67 rating across the tournament heading into the top-four stage.

Falcons' individuals nowhere to be seen
For a Falcons that was set up around the big individuals, it was a failure to show up across the board.

While there were moments from the likes of Maxim "⁠kyousuke⁠" Lukin on Nuke and NiKo early on Dust2, none of the star trio including m0NESY lit up the scoreboard.

The AWPer had come under fire on the analyst desk for his sub-par level at the biggest events of the year in Katowice, Austin and Cologne, and he ended Budapest with a 0.97 rating in the quarter-finals to end the year on a poor note.


m0NESY's stats in the year's Super-Elite events (Katowice, Cologne, Austin & Budapest)
For the team as a whole, it comes as yet another failure to deliver on their lofty goals. Danny "⁠zonic⁠" Sørensen had taken over the project two years ago with the aim to get a Major trophy within three years, and despite getting the stars he wanted from the beginning, Falcons ended 2025 with only one trophy, from PGL Bucharest, before m0NESY and kyousuke arrived.

"There will always be pressure because of the expectations we have for the team," Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski said after the elimination. "We won one trophy and we made a lot of finals, which maybe sounds not that bad, but we had higher expectations [...] It was not the best year for us."

The veteran rifler's contract will not be extended after his stand-in stint.


Magisk made his final appearance with Astralis at the Major
Emil "⁠Magisk⁠" Reif will not be part of Astralis' roster for 2026 after his stand-in stint, HLTV and Dust2.dk have learned, leaving the team with a second vacancy to fill amid Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz's reported impending transfer to 100 Thieves.

Magisk returned to Astralis in September for the final stretch of the season to replace Martin "⁠stavn⁠" Lund, who stepped down from the roster due to personal reasons.

The 27-year-old, who had won three Majors during his first stint with Astralis between 2018 and 2021, averaged a 1.00 rating while with the team, making his final appearance in Stage 2 of the Budapest Major.

During his second Astralis tenure, the team notably reached the playoffs at FISSURE Playground 2 and IEM Chengdu.

According to Dust2.dk's sources, it is unlikely that stavn will return to the starting roster at the end of the year.

The Danish organization is currently in the market for a new AWPer to replace device, who is set to reunite with his former teammate Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander in 100 Thieves' new project. gla1ve recently announced his retirement as a player and transition to coaching.


ESL announce IEM Rio return in 2026

The Farmasi Arena will host the playoffs on April 17-19.


IEM Rio was last played in 2024 and will return in 2026 after a one-year hiatus
IEM will return to Rio de Janeiro in 2026 as an ESL Pro Tour Masters tournament, and marks a partnership between EFG, FERJEE (the Rio de Janeiro Esports Federation), and the State of Rio de Janeiro. After not hosting an event in 2025, the 2026 tournament in Rio will continue a legacy that started with a Major in 2022 and was followed with events in 2023, and 2024.

IEM Rio 2026 will take place on April 13-19 with $1,000,000 on the line for the 16 competing teams, and the victor will get a notch in the race for the ESL Grand Slam. From April 17-19, the action will move to the Farmasi Arena, which has already played host to IEM Rio on previous occasions drawing an audience of 19,000 fans.

"IEM Rio has become emblematic, firmly establishing itself within our state and in the hearts of the Counter-Strike fans. Although the event did not take place in 2025, we remained active and used that period to plan ahead for upcoming editions, making the 2026 return possible," said Cadu Albuquerque, President of FERJEE. "This is only the beginning of a partnership that reflects the strength, commitment, and long-term vision of FERJEE and Rio towards the esports ecosystem."

The first of three waves of ticket sales will go live on December 15. Each ticket guarantees a seat to watch the tournament, as well as access to all other public areas of the event.

The international squad is looking to "add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth."


Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson's time with GamerLegion is coming to an end after a year-and-a-half as he is getting moved to the bench following a slow end to 2025.

This news comes right after Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye announced that he was stepping down from his position as the team's coach due to burnout, at least momentarily, shaking up the team's leadership structure.

ash steps down from GamerLegion due to burnout
The Swedish in-game leader joined GamerLegion from Metizport in July 2024, and led the team to its peak #9 in the HLTV ranking (#8 in the VRS) in June. The European squad failed to hold on, however, and dipped down the rankings falling out of the top 20 by the end of the year.

GamerLegion looked like they were on an upward trajectory early on in the year and about to break through in top competition with playoff runs at events like PGL Bucharest, IEM Melbourne, and IEM Dallas, but in the end regressed after the summer all the way to a 12-14th finish in the Budapest Major's first stage.

Now, with ash taking time and ztr on the bench, GamerLegion are at a crux heading into the winter, an off-season that was already heating up amid an approach by 100 Thieves concerning the team's core.

"We want to thank Erik for his professionalism, dedication, and the outstanding character he brought to our team," GamerLegion told HLTV. "Our goal is to add more experience to the roster to better support the team’s long-term growth. Erik has been an exemplary player and an exceptional person throughout his time with us, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."
