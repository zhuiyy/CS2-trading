NiKo will face donk for the fourth time in 2025.


Spirit will face Falcons in the marquee matchup of the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs, as an in-form Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets looks to overcome Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač for the first time in 2025.

The only team to not return to playoffs after making top-eight in Austin is paiN, with Falcons replacing them in what is already the Saudi organization's best result at a Valve-sponsored event.

That makes it a stacked bracket consisting of eight top-10 teams, as of the live VRS, ready to fight for Counter-Strike's most prestigous title.

The top half of the bracket will also see a rematch of the Austin Major grand final as Vitality take on The MongolZ.

Then, hometown hero Ádám "⁠torzsi⁠" Torzsás's MOUZ side will take on Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen's FaZe Clan to kick off Friday.

Finally, world number one FURIA face Natus Vincere as Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo bids to win his first Major since 2016.

The event will serve as the second Major of the year, running between November and December.


PGL has announced that it will host the second Major of 2026 in Singapore on November 25-December 13 featuring a $1,250,000 prize pool.

The Major will have 32 teams playing through three stages before moving to the 12,000 capacity Singapore Indoor Stadium for the playoffs, where the tournament will conclude with a best-of-five grand final to crown the champion.

After the Perfect World Shanghai Major broke the barrier for the whole of Asia to get Counter-Strike's most prestigious event in 2024, PGL will now bring a Major to Southeast Asia for the first time.

The event in Singapore will mark PGL's fifth time hosting a Major after PGL Krakow 2017, PGL Stockholm 2021, PGL Antwerp 2022, and PGL Copenhagen 2024. PGL has also hosted several DOTA 2 events in Singapore, including The International in 2022.

"Singapore has been host to exciting esports events such as The International, the largest DOTA 2 esports event in the world, and we look forward with much anticipation to hosting our first Counter Strike Major in 2026, which will reinforce Singapore as a world-class events destination," says Ms. Jean Ng, an Assistant Chief Executive from the Singapore Tourism Board.

"As one of the most prestigious tournaments in the Counter-Strike scene, the event promises to attract fans from around the region, and we invite them to also enjoy Singapore’s lifestyle experiences and vibrant energy."

The program will come back for a second installment in 2026, with the first event of the year being IEM Krakow, set to being on January 28.
