The Kamil "⁠siuhy⁠" Szkaradek-led side had traversed Stage 2 by the skin of their teeth, but the Stage 3 opposition proved too difficult to handle on day one as Liquid immediately dropped to the elimination zone after best-of-one losses to The MongolZ and Spirit.

T sides were the source of their woes on the opening day and the trend continued in the series against Passion UA.

Liquid got off to a 9-3 start on Train but couldn't convert the lead once sides switched, giving out on their offense as Passion UA kept them at bay with a dynamic CT side.

Johnny "⁠JT⁠" Theodosiou seemingly read Liquid like an open book with aggressive moves and spot-on rotations wherever they went, securing the opener 13-11 despite the slow start.

Mirage was just more of the same with Liquid struggling to make their opening moves work across the map, with Vladyslav "⁠Kvem⁠" Korol and JT leading the way to another 10-2 CT half.


Closing out the match from there turned out a more difficult prospect than anticipated as Liquid got within one round after a flawless start to their defense.

In the end, Passion UA finally broke through with an A split in round 20 and went on to punish a double-AWP setup in the following round, sending Liquid packing two rounds later.
