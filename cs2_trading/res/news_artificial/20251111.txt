The organization will return to the title after five years.

100 Thieves have announced their return to Counter-Strike after more than five years away from the title.

"Counter-Strike has always been a cornerstone of esports, and CS2 has sparked new energy worldwide," said Jacob Toft-Andersen, 100 Thieves' president.

"Europe is at the center of that community, and by establishing a permanent home there, we're committing to doing this the right way."

The news comes after a report from Dust2.dk stated that the organization is set to re-enter CS and sign Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard as the first piece of the puzzle.

100 Thieves' press release makes no mention of player signings, only that "further details about the new team roster and competitive schedule will be announced in the coming months."

This is set to be 100 Thieves' third stint in Counter-Strike. The organization first joined the space by signing the ex-Immortals team back in 2017, but the partnership ended unceremoniously after the lineup failed to play a single game for Nadeshot's American organization.

100 Thieves then returned in 2019 with a majority Australian lineup featuring Justin "⁠jks⁠" Savage and notably finished second at IEM Beijing before departing the space in October 2020.
