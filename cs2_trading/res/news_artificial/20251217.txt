The Russian sniper is on the market after eight months on Falcons' bench.


Abdul "⁠degster⁠" Gasanov has announced his free agency following the termination of his contract with Falcons, bringing to an end the AWPer's year-long stint with the Saudi organization.

"I can confidently say that I have a tireless desire to work to achieve success with a new team and organization," degster said in a statement on X.

degster initially signed for Falcons in January of this year alongside Damjan "⁠kyxsan⁠" Stoilkovski and René "⁠TeSeS⁠" Madsen, joining as part of the former HEROIC core that would bring with them their VRS points.
