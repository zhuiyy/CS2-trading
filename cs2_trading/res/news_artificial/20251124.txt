Short: neL sheds light on NRG decision
"After talking with daps, they actually asked multiple people, but there was still a good chance nitr0 could play," neL said on X about NRG's decision to have Damian "⁠daps⁠" Steele step in to play. "Most didn't want to IGL and play nitr0's spots."

"The team decided daps playing was the best solution, as he knows the team/system and can IGL. Understandable."

gla1ve announces retirement; moves into coaching

Astralis' iconic IGL hangs up his mouse and keyboard, moving on to a new phase in his life.


Former Astralis captain Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander has announced that he is retiring from playing and moving into coaching.

The 30-year-old had been out of action since July, when he was moved to ENCE's bench after 18 months with the team. During his time with the Finnish organization, he notably led the squad to victory at Elisa Masters Espoo 2024 — the final LAN trophy of his career.

gla1ve: "I truly believe I have something extraordinary to offer [as a coach]"
But what gla1ve will mostly be remembered by — and what will make him a strong Hall of Fame candidate in the future — will be his achievements with Astralis. Signed in October 2016 to replace Finn "⁠karrigan⁠" Andersen, gla1ve guided the team to their first Major trophy a few months into his stint against Virtus.pro in Atlanta.

He then played a key role as Astralis built an era of dominance in 2018 and 2019, winning 16 titles, including three more Majors, and the first edition of the Intel Grand Slam.


gla1ve won four Majors during his career, all with Astralis
"What a ride it has been," he wrote in a post on X. "So many memories, so many victories, and lessons I’ll carry with me forever.

"I still get goosebumps thinking about the Majors, the Intel Grand Slam, and everything we built during the golden Astralis era. To be part of creating something that special doesn’t happen often. A huge thank you to my incredible teammates and coaches from back then—you made it some of the best years of my life."

Widely praised for his leadership ability and tactical acumen, gla1ve was also a skilled player in his own right, making HLTV's Top 20 Player of the Year ranking in 2018 at No.8. He was named the MVP of IEM Beijing 2019, where he posted a tournament-high 1.48 rating, and was among the EVPs on 12 occasions.

His time on Astralis' roster came to an end in July 2023, when he was replaced by Victor "⁠Staehr⁠" Staehr and Benjamin "⁠blameF⁠" Bremer took over as captain. Four months later, he signed with ENCE, where he immediately had to deal with a storm as three players were on their way out of the team.

With the former 9INE core in tow, gla1ve guided ENCE to the playoffs at IEM Katowice 2024 and through the Europe RMR leading to the Copenhagen Major. But as results deteriorated, ENCE moved away from the Polish core, signing Viktor "⁠sdy⁠" Orudzhev and promoting Paavo "⁠podi⁠" Heiskanen from the academy squad.

And the team ended 2024 on a high note: with only five days of practice after the arrivals of Ryan "⁠Neityu⁠" Aubry and Kacper "⁠xKacpersky⁠" Gabara, they beat 9z, The MongolZ, and HEROIC en route to the title in Espoo.

gla1ve's final LAN appearance was at the Tipsport Conquest of Prague 2025 Finals, where ENCE finished second to fnatic. Weeks later, the Finnish organization would sign Rigon "⁠rigoN⁠" Gashi to the team and hand the captaincy duties over to sdy.

gla1ve becomes the third member of Astralis' iconic team to retire from playing, after Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth and Peter "⁠dupreeh⁠" Rasmussen. Like the 'Clutch Minister,' he will try his hand at coaching — which he views as a natural progression for his career after his time on the server.

"I have always known that I would become a coach once my career as a player ended," he told HLTV.

"I have learned so many useful things throughout my career as an IGL, both in-game and also outside the game, and now I am just looking forward to being able to use all that as a coach.

"I am still here to lead a team to victory. That part hasn't changed."
