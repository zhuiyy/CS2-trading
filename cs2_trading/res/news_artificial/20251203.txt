The Danish former professional player is beginning his coaching career with a big project.


Former Astralis and ENCE captain is on the brink of joining 100 Thieves as head coach, multiple sources told HLTV. The news comes less than two weeks after the 30-year-old announced his retirement from playing to become a coach.

Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander will become the second piece of 100 Thieves' new squad after Håvard "⁠rain⁠" Nygaard, who was signed from FaZe last month.

100 Thieves have also hired Graham "⁠messioso⁠" Pitt as Head of CS Operations and Sean "⁠seang@res⁠" Gares as Head of FPS to oversee the organization's return to the game after a five-year absence.

Shortly after announcing their re-entry, 100 Thieves were rumored to be interested in signing GamerLegion's core.
