As ESL Impact is put on hold, women's CS faces an uncertain future
MIRAA
28-11-2025 19:00
Several community figures share their thoughts on the shuttering of the biggest women's CS league.


The ESL Impact 8 Finals will kick off Friday in Stockholm. After this event, the league will be put on indefinite hold
"I was so fucking right about it."

Ksenia "⁠vilga⁠" Kluenkova bursts into laughter when her 2022 remarks about how ESL Impact has revived the women's scene are put to her.

The irony of the situation is not lost on her. We're mere days away from the ESL Impact 8 Finals in Stockholm, and emotions are running high. The event will mark the end of a chapter as ESL has decided to pause the women's circuit at the end of the season, claiming that the "current economic model is simply not sustainable."

ESL to suspend Impact circuit
vilga was one of the first Impact players to react to ESL's October 3 announcement, saying in a post on X that the decision would leave "a gap that cannot be overstated."

Since establishing Impact at the start of 2022 as part of the GG For All initiative, ESL has provided the scene with a much-needed jolt of energy, distributing over $1.5 million in prize money alone across eight seasons of play, standalone LAN events, and numerous one-off online cash cups.

In many ways, Impact has achieved what it set out to accomplish: become a safe place for female players and create many stars, most notably Ana "⁠ANa⁠" Dumbravă, the three-time Women's Player of the Year.

When vilga learned that ESL was pulling the plug on Impact, she was livid. But her NIP Impact teammates took it even harder. "My team was completely broken," she recalls to HLTV. "I had players crying."

At 34, she has seen and experienced more than most, from the messy transition from CS 1.6 to CS:GO to the exodus of players and organizations to VALORANT during the pandemic, when there was nothing to play for and she could "count the number of teams left with the fingers of one hand."


A veteran of the scene, vilga has gone through multiple cycles of highs and lows
If there's one thing that her journey has taught her, it's that everything should be taken in stride.

"Otherwise, living this life is going to be really difficult," she explains. "At the end of the day, everything in this world is neutral. It's all about the perspective you have on the situation and the events that are happening to you."

Several people that HLTV spoke with for this article mentioned that there had been signs that all was not well with Impact. Chief among them was the fact that ESL had reduced the number of yearly LAN events from three to two after running standalone events in Valencia (2022) and Katowice (2023), in addition to the two seasons per year.

At the end of 2023, ESL announced that Season 6 of ESL Impact would be the first without any Asia-Pacific slot, instead distributing the eight Stockholm Finals spots between Europe, North America and South America.

This eventually forced HSG fe to relocate to Europe to play in that region's open qualifier for Season 6 and then in the league. After reaching the semis in the Season 5 Finals, HSG fe finished in 7th-8th place in the European league, a result Olga "⁠Olga⁠" Rodrigues attributed in part to the extraordinary circumstances.

"I think what affected us the most was being away from home for so long," said Olga, who is now playing for MIBR fe. "I think I was the only one who had stayed away from home for so long, so I don't think it was a problem for me. But for some of the other players, not only being away, but also the different food and routine was a factor."

Ramona "⁠gfi⁠" Azween Binti Zaharuddin, who was also part of the roster, estimates that HSG fe's management spent around $70,000 during the three months the team stayed in Europe.

"It was a huge effort from our boss, and not an ideal situation for the team at all," gfi said. "It felt like we were constantly running, trying to keep up with something that honestly felt mentally impossible at times.

"And I still feel sad about it today. I wish things had been different, because in the end we also let our boss down despite everything he did for us."

In December 2024, ESL confirmed that Impact would continue to feature only those three regions. HSG fe would disband only a few months into 2025.


After finishing top 4 in Season 5, HSG fe was forced to relocate to Europe to play
"For someone coming from Asia, this isn't something new," gfi added. "No matter how hard we work or how much we prove with our results, somehow our region always gets put in this same position again.

"So even with an Asian team making it to the semi-finals and showing we could deliver results, even coming from such an underdeveloped female region, the decision didn’t just take away our chance to compete; it basically killed our whole scene. Impact was the only real pathway that connected us to the global stage, and once it was gone, everything we were trying to build here just stopped.

"It’s also personal for me. Impact was the reason I even got the chance to build HSG in the first place, to create a place where Asian players, including myself, could chase our dreams. I spent my whole youth building that team, and seeing the region lose its opportunities like this hit very deeply.

"Even after all of this, I still hope every day that I’ll get the chance to compete again."

With the ESL FACEIT Group having undergone multiple rounds of layoffs as part of a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving profitability, many saw the writing on the wall.

The loss of Impact is a huge blow for women's CS. The circuit has become a cornerstone of the scene with its $300,000 annual prize pool (in addition to its $700,000 club incentives, introduced in 2025), guarantee of LAN events and high production quality. All that is going away in a heartbeat in a few days, so the question on many minds is who will fill such a massive void.

FERJEE, an acronym for the Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Electronic Sports, will run the first edition of 'Clutch Queens,' the international version of 'Rainhas do Clutch,' its women-only Brazilian tournament, in the first half of 2026. It will take place in Rio de Janeiro and feature nearly $65,000 in prize money and club share.


Rainhas do Clutch will go international next year
FERJEE president Cadu Albuquerque told Dust2 Brasil that his organization cannot confirm plans for a second global event in 2026, and called on more tournament organizers to help keep the women's scene alive.

VANTA and JB.com have announced that the JB Pro League will be expanded to feature a women-only tournament with a $25,000 prize pool. There are also other tournaments providing regular action to teams, such as the Female Pro League, whose first edition recently culminated in LAN Finals in Kazakhstan, and ELITE FE, backed by Vitality and Skin.Club.

"We have seen what happened, and we want to contribute," a JB Pro League representative told HLTV. "More details will be shared on our channels soon. What we can say is that we will deliver what is asked in the scene."


But is all that enough to keep organizations from leaving? So far, most seem to be playing a waiting game to see what the circuit will look like next year before making a decision.

There are, however, some exceptions, such as FlyQuest, who pledged their support to the RED project the same day ESL announced that it would suspend Impact.

"Women's CS is facing a major setback with the shutdown of the ESL Impact circuit, but RED's identity has never depended on a single league," FlyQuest CCO and FlyQuest RED director Stephanie "⁠missharvey⁠" Harvey told HLTV. "Having been part of this space for over two decades, I have watched our scene move through many formats, systems, and eras, and my commitment to it has never wavered.

"Our mission does not pause when things get hard. With the primary women’s circuit gone, our presence becomes even more important, and we intend to remain active in the scene.

"We do not yet know how the competitive ecosystem will shift in 2026, but we are not stepping back. We will keep supporting our players, continue investing in the scene, and work with any organization committed to sustaining women’s Counter-Strike. We are evaluating and hoping for potential collaboration with teams like FURIA, MIBR, BIG, NIP, and Imperial to determine where joint efforts could be helpful.

"The landscape may change, but our commitment does not."


Imperial CEO Felippe "⁠felippe⁠" Martins suggested that his organization will continue supporting the Valkyries, the three-time Women's Team of the Year.

"The end of ESL Impact is undoubtedly a hard blow to the scene, but it is far from definitive," felippe told HLTV. "Today, Brazil has organisations investing heavily in infrastructure, as well as great players competing. From a business perspective, we will all need to reinvent ourselves and understand how the project can continue to generate value outside the server.

"The good news is that organisations are already coming together to lead new movements for the competitive scene. FERJEE did great in bringing Rainhas do Clutch to the first half of the year, with a substantial prize that helps keep the ecosystem active.

"Of course, there is a big challenge in understanding how the market will react, but we are optimistic about the possibilities that are emerging, both in Brazil and abroad."


Imperial Valkyries are the reigning Women's Team of the Year
Earlier this month, North American organization Sakura signed the Shimmer roster, offering the scene a glimmer of hope against a backdrop of uncertainty.

Contacted by HLTV, Sakura General Manager Abigail "Skyza" Bolton said the organization's involvement in the women's scene beyond the Impact Finals remains up in the air. "Once additional information comes out, we will make a call, but we would love to continue to support the team," Skyza said.

The most recent example of how murky the future looks came on Monday, when Brazilian organization Four Magic let go of their team, just 24 hours after it had won SuperCopa Feminina over FURIA fe, the reigning Impact champions, and Dusty Roses.

"Yesterday, they gave us a title, which will forever be remembered," Four Magic wrote on X. "And may your next chapter be even more magical!"

Mixed feelings
FlyQuest RED captain Mounira "⁠GooseBreeder⁠" Dobie, who has attended every ESL Impact Finals on LAN, believes the impending shuttering of the circuit comes at a time when "the women’s scene is probably in the healthiest state it has ever been."

"We’re now seeing the fruits of that labor: the player base has grown for sure, as well as the overall skill across the Impact scene," she says.

"North America, for example, has more teams than ever during my time competing, and Europe has seen a lot of growth as well. A lot of organizations have also got involved throughout the span of Impact; it showed how much can be done with a circuit as promising as Impact."


GooseBreder says the upcoming Impact Finals "will be magical"
vilga shares the same opinion. She points to Imperial Valkyries overtime loss on Mirage to FURIA at IEM Katowice, their competitive BLAST Bounty series against Natus Vincere in January, and her own team's map win against Eternal Fire in CCT back in June as evidence of how much women's teams have elevated their play in recent years.

"That would never have happened without Impact," she argued. "They built this ground for us to continue to develop, and I just really hope that we will only continue growing from here, without having to switch to another game.

"Otherwise, it will have just been a waste."

Impact has proved a breeding ground not just for players, but also for coaches and on-air talent. Viktor "⁠flashie⁠" Tamás Bea, Jhonatan "⁠jnt⁠" Silva and Jonathan "⁠MusambaN1⁠" Torrent are some examples of coaches who have gone on to bigger jobs after guiding women's teams.

"It's very sad to see the end of Impact," said Liquid coach flashie, who guided the CLG Red/FlyQuest RED team between 2020 and 2023.

"It was a very good initiative that was a huge part of the development curve for women CS. I competed in Impact and I managed to improve my communication skills and coaching a lot thanks to the league."


flashie coached in ESL Impact before joining NAVI as an analyst
Australian commentator Lucy "LucyLuce" Eastwood, now a regular face in tier-one tournaments, had her breakthrough in 2022 thanks to Impact.

"We've been part of ESL Impact since the beginning," LucyLuce said of her and Brandon "BDog" Rawlings, her casting partner. "This is where my first ever cast was, where Brandon and I got started. So heavy hearts for sure, but we want to go out with a bang and make sure it's the memorable final it deserves."

As a veil of uncertainty and a sense of finality accompany the upcoming Impact Finals in Stockholm, it's no surprise that players are wrestling with emotions in the lead-up to the event.

"I'm very excited and proud that we managed to qualify for the last Impact season," vilga says. "But if I dig deeply, I feel emptiness, to be honest with you."

"I feel like I’m in a good headspace, considering the circumstances," GooseBreeder reflects. "I’m grateful to be attending the final Impact event ever. I’m even more grateful to attend it with some of the best teammates I’ve ever had.

"I think this event will be magical, so I’m looking forward to savoring the moment with my team and making the most of it."

At this point, how women's CS will look in 2026 and beyond is anyone's guess. But for a few days at least, vilga will put any dark thoughts aside. Even if the worst comes to pass, she says, she and her teammates "will figure it out," ever driven by their undying love for the game.

This is painfully familiar territory for her. And no matter how bleak things may get, she knows that her scene has always managed to persevere and that every dark cloud has carried a silver lining.

"I believe in a better future, and I believe that better things will appear."
