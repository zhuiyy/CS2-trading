Aleksib's troops let a 10-3 lead slip on map two only to knock out the world number one out on the decider.


FURIA entered the MVM Dome in sunglasses, but it was Natus Vincere who basked in the sun as they sent the favorites for the Major trophy home early.

It makes it two upsets out of two on a wild Friday in Budapest, after FaZe took MOUZ out earlier, as NAVI earned revenge for the Thunderpick World Championship grand final where they surrendered a 2-0 lead in the best of five to Gabriel "⁠FalleN⁠" Toledo's troops.

Aleksi "⁠Aleksib⁠" Virolainen must have been feeling déjà vu from that Malta final as Natus Vincere let a 10-3 lead on map two slip to 13-16, especially after a crushing FalleN 1v3 that left Mihai "⁠iM⁠" Ivan with his head in his hands and with FURIA in possession of all of the momentum as the decider began on Train.

But, against all logic, Natus Vincere dug deep into their reserves to untilt and march on to a dominant 13-3 victory on the Train decider.

As ever with the Andrey "⁠B1ad3⁠" Gorodenskiy-led squad, it was a story of tactical success that secured the upset. But there was also the individual factor Natus Vincere has so often lacked in 2025, with Ihor "⁠w0nderful⁠" Zhdanov continuing his fantastic group stage form from the off with a 1.52 rating on map one and a 12-2 K-D after ten rounds on map three.

It was w0nderful's round one quad-kill set the tone for a NAVI performance that knocked FURIA completely off-kilter at the start of the series. Danil "⁠molodoy⁠" Golubenko was suffocated on Mirage (and all series), as Natus Vincere's layered A pops worked time and time again.

On Inferno, Natus Vincere's CT game plan was just as effective. Early A hits failed, including a key anti-force in round 2, and FURIA had little success on the other bomb-site as the half developed.

Drin "⁠makazze⁠" Shaqiri's statistics may not stand out, but his decisiveness in taking full Banana control forced FURIA into playing far slower than they would have wanted to. A round where makazze jumped right over Banana spacetaker Kaike "⁠KSCERATO⁠" Cerato's head was emblematic of NAVI's disruptive preparation paying off.

But FURIA did not earn a 70% win-rate in close games this season by accident, and they gradually built back into the match on their CT side. FalleN led the way by denying an iM 1v5, before adding his back-breaking 1v3 clutch at 10-10. NAVI did well to fight back and lead 12-11, but FURIA were stronger in overtime to go into the decider with a massive mental edge.

And yet, none of that materialized on Train. Natus Vincere stormed out into the Outer bomb-site in the pistol for an Aleksib triple-kill, and momentum was suddenly theirs. NAVI's strength all series long was in their first-half game plans, and they saved the best for last as they made their way to a 9-1 lead on the T side of Train.

After one miracle comeback on Inferno, some of the travelling fans in the arena may have been expecting one more favor from their beloved Professor. But it was not to be, as Natus Vincere ran out deserved winners to blow the race for the Major trophy wide open.

molodoy's luck runs dry

For all Natus Vincere's preparation, however, we did not see the same FURIA that won four trophies this season. The team can point to so many days off since they went 3-0 in groups (a run which included a 13-2 win over NAVI), or to losing five pistols and an anti-force after the one half-starter they won, but the truth is that a team known for its resilience crumbled under the pressure.

And that was not true for anyone more than molodoy. The Kazakh sniper's rookie year has been one of fantastic success, but there are now two blemishes against his record in the Majors. He was bottom of the board against paiN in Austin and, here in Budapest, he finishes as one of the worst CT performers in the event.

In Danil "⁠donk⁠" Kryshkovets's era, it is comforting to know that other modern rookies are human. It is reasonable that molodoy would feel the pressure as the star player of the world number one in only his second Major playoff series. But we also must hold him to the high standards he has hit so consistently in 2025, and it is clear he fell far below them against Natus Vincere with a 0.81 rating and just 55.4 ADR.

On the flipside, Natus Vincere's rookie makazze made a statement with a 2.23 rating on Train as a just reward for his tireless efforts as the team's spacetaker all series long.

The spirit of Copenhagen burns bright





Last time Natus Vincere won a Major, it was as true outsiders in Copenhagen. And that is true again in Budapest, with Justinas "⁠jL⁠" Lekavicius watching on from the stands.

This win, then, is a warning of what a fully prepared B1ad3 and Aleksib side are capable of. The game plans were immaculate, as Natus Vincere tamed molodoy and knocked the crown off of the world number one with ease.

If it was not for the second half of Inferno, where FalleN's heroics kept his team's Major alive, Natus Vincere would have knocked FURIA out without breaking a sweat. But doing so after fumbling that lead, somehow, seems even more unlikely a scenario for a team whose mental chops have been questioned in 2025.

"[B1ad3] said after the map, 'forget this map,'" iM told James "⁠BanKs⁠" Banks on stage post-game. "'Just play Train like nothing happened.' It doesn't matter that we won Mirage, that we lost Inferno, that we lost clutches, or whatever. Even after that 1v3, I didn't hear anything in TeamSpeak that was like we were tilted. We were trying to say, focus up, it doesn't matter."

And as fate would have it, it's Copenhagen's Major finalist FaZe who are next in Natus Vincere's path.

Snax returns to GamerLegion

The Pole is back for a second stint in the organization.


GamerLegion have announced the return of Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski, with the Polish IGL set to take the place of the recently benched Erik "⁠ztr⁠" Gustafsson.

The announcement follows a busy period for GamerLegion, who also lost coach Ashley "⁠ash⁠" Battye due to burnout and had their core linked with a potential move to 100 Thieves.

This will be Snax's second stint in the organization after the Pole led the team for just under a year during 2023-2024 and notably helped them qualify for the PGL Major Copenhagen before departing for G2.

At the time, GamerLegion replaced him with ztr, with the organization now reversing the decision by snapping up the out-of-contract IGL.

The Pole will aim to stabilize a team whose form has deteriorated in recent months, slipping from the VRS top 10 to 25th after a run of disappointing performances, including a 1–3 exit at the Budapest Major Stage 1.
