Short: Nodios announces break from competition

Magnus "⁠Nodios⁠" Olsen has announced that he is taking an indefinite career break "due to the recent circumstances."

He said that, for legal reasons, he is unable to share more information about the past few months. His second Tricked stint came to an end on October 1, when his contract was terminated.

"There has simply been more happening behind the scenes than most people get to see," he added.

Short: messioso hints 100T won't be NA-focused
"My championing of NA was very much tied to Complexity and the brand/roster we were building," Graham "⁠messioso⁠" Pitt, 100 Thieves' new Head of CS Operations, said in response to a fan speculating on the organization's new roster.

"While I think that having a strong NA region is important for the health of the global CS ecosystem, it's not going to be something that drives player signings here at 100T unless the player is genuinely who we want for what they bring on the server."

HLTV and 1xBET have partnered up to give the community a chance to influence a piece of Counter-Strike history.

Together with 1xBET, we designed three variations of the medal for the final tournament of the year — and you can decide which one will be handed out to the MVP of the StarLadder Budapest Major.




Each design features references to the host city as well as Counter-Strike elements. Check out all three options in the carousel and find your favorite. And then cast your vote in the widget below:
